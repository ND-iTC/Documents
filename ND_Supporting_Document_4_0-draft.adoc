= Supporting Document - Evaluation Activities for Network Device cPP

Version: 4.0
Date: TBD November 2025

== Acknowledgements

This collaborative Protection Profile (cPP) was developed by the Network Device international Technical Community (ND iTC) with representatives from industry, government agencies, Common Criteria Test Laboratories, and members of academia.

== Preface

This is a Supporting Document (SD), intended to complement the Common Criteria (CC) Version CC:2022, Revision 1 and the associated Common Evaluation Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CEM).

Supporting documents may be “Guidance Documents”, that highlight specific approaches and application of the standard to areas where no mutual recognition of its application is required, and as such, are not of normative nature, or “Mandatory Technical Documents”, whose application is mandatory for evaluations whose scope is covered by that of the supporting document. The usage of the latter class is not only mandatory, but certificates issued as a result of their application are recognised under the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA). This SD shall be considered a Mandatory Technical Document.

This SD has been developed by the ND iTC, in accordance with part 4 of [CC]. The SD is intended to be used to support the evaluations of products against the collaborative Protection Profile (cPP) identified in Section 1.1.

== Introduction

=== Technology Area and Scope of Supporting Document
[arabic]
. This Supporting Document (SD) defines the Evaluation Activities (EA) associated with the collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices [NDcPP].
. The ND technical area has a number of specialised aspects, such as those relating to the secure implementation and use of protocols, and to the particular ways in which remote management facilities need to be assessed across a range of different physical and logical interfaces for different types of infrastructure devices. This degree of specialisation, and the associations between individual Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in the cPP, make it important for both efficiency and effectiveness that evaluation activities are given more specific interpretations than those found in the generic CEM activities.
. This Supporting Document is mandatory for evaluations of products that claim conformance to the following cPP:
[loweralpha]
.. collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices [NDcPP]

[arabic, start=4]
. Although Evaluation Activities (EAs) are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, the definitions in this Supporting Document aim to provide a common understanding for developers, evaluators and users of the product as to what aspects of the TOE are tested in an evaluation against the associated cPPs, and to what depth the testing is carried out. This common understanding in turn contributes to the goal of ensuring that evaluations against the cPP achieve comparable, transparent and repeatable results. In general, the definition of Evaluation Activities will also help Developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE. The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of SFRs, and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security Targets (STs) (especially the TOE Summary Specification (TSS)), Administrator Guidance Documentation (AGD), and possibly supplementary information (e.g., for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture – see Section 6).

=== Structure of the Document
[arabic, start=5]
. Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs). These are defined in separate sections of this Supporting Document.
. If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then the overall verdict for the evaluation is a ‘fail’. In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, but this must be agreed with the Certification Body (CB) for the evaluation and documented in the evaluation report.
. In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
. Similarly, at the more granular level of Assurance Components, if the Evaluation Activities for an Assurance Component and all of its related SFR Evaluation Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the verdict for the Assurance Component is a ‘pass’.

=== Application of this Supporting Document
[arabic, start=9]
. This Supporting Document defines three types of Evaluation Activities: TOE Summary Specification, Guidance Documentation, and Tests, and is designed to be used in conjunction with a cPP. cPPs that rely on this SD will explicitly identify it as a source for their EAsfootnote:[In general, a cPP may reference one or more SDs as sources for the Evaluation Activities for different sets of SFRs.]. Each security requirement (SFR or SAR) specified in the cPP could have multiple EAs associated with it. The security requirement naming convention is consistent between the cPP and this SD, ensuring a clear one to one correspondence between security requirements and evaluation activities.
. The cPP and SD are designed to be used in conjunction with each other, where the cPP lists SFRs and SARs and the SD catalogues EAs associated with each SFR and SAR. Some of the SFRs included in the cPP are optional or selection-based. Therefore, an ST claiming conformance to the cPP does not necessarily have to include all possible SFRs defined in the cPP.
. In an ST conformant to the cPP, several operations need to be performed (mainly selections and assignments). Some EAs define separate actions for different selected or assigned values in SFRs. The evaluator shall neither carry out EAs related to SFRs that are not claimed in the ST nor EAs related to specific selected or assigned values that are not claimed in the ST.
. EAs do not necessarily have to be executed independently from each other. A description in a guidance documentation or one test case, for example, can cover multiple EAs at a time, no matter whether the EAs are related to the same or different SFRs.

== Evaluation Activities for SFRs
[arabic, start=14]
. The EAs presented in this section capture the actions the evaluator shall perform to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g., ASE_TSS.1, ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units that are performed in Section 5 (Evaluation Activities for SARs).
. Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TOE Summary Specification (TSS), as well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1. Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the cPP.
. For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for the Security Administrators as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will be associated with CEM work units AGD_OPE.1-4 and AGD_OPE.1-5.
. Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the iTC has determined that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary. While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the developer may have existing tests. Approval for using tests created by developers is up to the CB. The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.

_Additional Note for Distributed TOEs_
[arabic, start=18]
. For a distributed TOE, all examination of Operational Guidance information should be extended to include confirmation that it defines sufficient information to configure individual components such that the overall TOE is correctly established.
. Evaluation activities for SFRs must be carried out for all distributed TOE components that implement the SFR (as defined in the mapping of SFRs to components, see Section 5.1.2). This applies to optional and selection-based SFRs in Section 3 and 4 as well as to the core SFRs in this section.

=== Security Audit (FAU)

==== FAU_GEN.1 Audit data generation
[arabic, start=20]
. The main reasons for collecting audit information are to detect and identify error conditions, security violations, etc. and to provide sufficient information to the Security Administrator to resolve the issue. The audit information to be collected according to FAU_GEN.1, and the failure conditions identified in tables 2, 12, and 13 need to enable the Security Administrator at least to detect and identify the problem and provide at least basic information to resolve the issue. Also for this level of detail, the other FAU requirements apply, in particular the need for local and remote storage of audit information according to FAU_STG_EXT.1.
. The level of detail that needs to be provided to the Security Administrator to actually resolve an issue usually depends on the complexity of the underlying use case. It is expected that a product provides additional levels of auditing to support resolution of error conditions, security violations, etc. beyond the level required by FAU_GEN.1, but it should also be clear that a high level of granularity cannot be maintained on most systems by default due to the high number of audit events that would be generated in such a configuration. It is expected that the TOE will be capable of auditing sufficient information to meet the requirements of FAU_GEN.1. If the TOE allows configuration of the level of auditing without taking the TOE out of the evaluated configuration, some of the audit events required by FAU_GEN.1 may only be recorded after corresponding configuration of the audit functionality.
. The issue described above explicitly refers to the use of X.509v3 certificates. In the case that a certificate-based authentication fails, an error message telling the Security Administrator that ‘something is wrong with the certificate’ shall not be considered as sufficient information about the ‘reason for failure’ as a basic information to resolve the issue. The log message will inform the Security Administrator of at least the following:

* ‘Trust issue’ with the certificate, e.g., due to failed path validation
* Use of an ‘expired certificate’
* Absence of the basicConstraints extension
* The CA flag is not set for a certificate presented as a CA
* Signature validation failure for any certificate in the certificate path; failure to establish revocation status; revoked certificate

[arabic, start=23]
. As such for audit information related to the use of X.509v3 certificates, that it uniquely identifies the certificate that could not be successfully verified. For example, identification of a certificate could include Key Subject and Key ID (where Key Subject is an identifier contained in the CN or SAN and where Key ID is a certificate's serial number and issuer name) or Subject Key Identifier (SKI) and Authority Key Identifier (AKI). In general, when using open source libraries like OpenSSL, passing on error messages from such libraries to the Security Administrator is regarded as good practice.

===== TSS
[arabic, start=24]
. For the administrative task of generating/import of, changing, or deleting of cryptographic keys as defined in FAU_GEN.1.1c, the TSS shall identify what information is logged to identify the relevant key.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes which of the overall required auditable events defined in FAU_GEN.1.1 are generated and recorded by which TOE components. The evaluator shall ensure that this mapping of audit events to TOE components accounts for, and is consistent with, information provided in Table 1, as well as events in Tables 2, 12, and 13 (where applicable to the overall TOE). This includes that the evaluator shall confirm that all components defined as generating audit information for a particular SFR should also contribute to that SFR as defined in the mapping of SFRs to TOE components, and that the audit records generated by each component cover all the SFRs that it implements.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=26]
. The evaluator shall check the guidance documentation and ensure that it provides an example of each auditable event required by FAU_GEN.1 (i.e., at least one instance of each auditable event, comprising the mandatory, optional and selection-based SFR sections as applicable, shall be provided from the actual audit record).
. The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions related to TSF data related to configuration changes. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation and make a determination of which administrative commands, including subcommands, scripts, and configuration files, are related to the configuration (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE that are necessary to enforce the requirements specified in the cPP. The evaluator shall document the methodology or approach taken while determining which actions in the administrative guide are related to TSF data related to configuration changes. The evaluator may perform this activity as part of the activities associated with ensuring that the corresponding guidance documentation satisfies the requirements related to it.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=28]
. The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE generate audit records for the events listed in the table of audit events and the administrative actions listed above. This should include all instances of an event; for instance, if there are several different Identity and Authentication (I&A) mechanisms for a system, the FIA_UIA_EXT.1 events must be generated for each mechanism. The evaluator shall test that audit records are generated for the establishment and termination of a channel for each of the cryptographic protocols contained in the ST. If HTTPS is implemented, the test demonstrating the establishment and termination of a TLS session can be combined with the test for an HTTPS session. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the guidance documentation, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall perform tests on all TOE components according to the mapping of auditable events to TOE components in the Security Target. For all events involving more than one TOE component when an audit event is triggered, the evaluator has to check that the event has been audited on both sides (e.g., failure of building up a secure communication channel between the two components). This is not limited to error cases but includes also events about successful actions like successful build up/tear down of a secure communication channel between TOE components.
. Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly.

==== FAU_GEN.2 User identity association

===== TSS & Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=31]
. The TSS and Guidance Documentation requirements for FAU_GEN.2 are already covered by the TSS and Guidance Documentation requirements for FAU_GEN.1.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=32]
. This activity should be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of FAU_GEN.1.1.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall verify that where auditable events are instigated by another component, the component that records the event associates the event with the identity of the instigator. The evaluator shall perform at least one test on one component where another component instigates an auditable event. The evaluator shall verify that the event is recorded by the component as expected and the event is associated with the instigating component. It is assumed that an event instigated by another component can at least be generated for building up a secure channel between two TOE components. If for some reason (could be e.g., TSS or Guidance Documentation) the evaluator would come to the conclusion that the overall TOE does not generate any events instigated by other components, then this requirement shall be omitted.

==== FAU_STG_EXT.1 Protected audit event storage

===== TSS
[arabic, start=34]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the means by which the audit data are transferred to the external audit server, and how the trusted channel is provided.
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes whether the TOE is a standalone TOE that stores audit data locally or a distributed TOE that stores audit data locally on each TOE component or a distributed TOE that contains TOE components that cannot store audit data locally on themselves but need to transfer audit data to other TOE components that can store audit data locally. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that for distributed TOEs it contains a list of TOE components that store audit data locally. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that for distributed TOEs that contain components which do not store audit data locally but transmit their generated audit data to other components it contains a mapping between the transmitting and storing TOE components.
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it details whether the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity can be done in real-time, periodically, or both. In the case where the TOE is capable of performing transmission periodically, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS provides details about what event stimulates the transmission to be made as well as the possible acceptable frequency for the transfer of audit data.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes to which TOE components this SFR applies and how audit data transfer to the external audit server is implemented among the different TOE components (e.g., every TOE component does its own transfer or the data is sent to another TOE component for central transfer of all audit events to the external audit server).
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the amount of audit data that can be stored locally and how these records are protected against unauthorised modification or deletion.
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the method implemented for local logging, including format (e.g., buffer, log file, database) and whether the logs are persistent or non-persistent.
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the conditions that must be met for authorised deletion of audit records.
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it details the behaviour of the TOE when the storage space for audit data is full. When the option ‘overwrite previous audit record’ is selected this description should include an outline of the rule for overwriting audit data. If ‘other actions’ are chosen such as sending the new audit data to an external IT entity, then the related behaviour of the TOE shall also be detailed in the TSS.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes which TOE components are storing audit information locally and which components are buffering audit information and forwarding the information to another TOE component for local storage. For every component the TSS shall describe the behaviour when local storage space or buffer space is exhausted.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=43]
. The evaluator shall also examine the guidance documentation to ensure it describes how to establish the trusted channel to the audit server, as well as describe any requirements on the audit server (particular audit server protocol, version of the protocol required, etc.), as well as configuration of the TOE needed to communicate with the audit server.
. The evaluator shall also examine the guidance documentation to ensure it describes the relationship between the local audit data and the audit data that are sent to the audit log server. For example, when an audit event is generated, is it simultaneously sent to the external server and the local store, or is the local store used as a buffer and “cleared” periodically by sending the data to the audit server.
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure it describes any configuration required for protection of the locally stored audit data against unauthorised modification or deletion.
. If the storage size is configurable, the evaluator shall review the Guidance Documentation to ensure it contains instructions on specifying the required parameters.
. If more than one selection is made for FAU_STG_EXT.1.5, the evaluator shall review the Guidance Documentation to ensure it contains instructions on specifying which action is performed when the local storage space is full.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=48]
. Testing of secure transmission of the audit data externally (FTP_ITC.1) and, where applicable, intercomponent (FPT_ITT.1 or FTP_ITC.1) shall be performed according to the assurance activities for the particular protocol(s). 
. The evaluator shall perform the following additional test for this requirement:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall establish a session between the TOE and the audit server according to the configuration guidance provided. The evaluator shall then examine the traffic that passes between the audit server and the TOE during several activities of the evaluator’s choice designed to generate audit data to be transferred to the audit server. The evaluator shall observe that these data are not able to be viewed in the clear during this transfer, and that they are successfully received by the audit server. The evaluator shall record the particular software (name, version) used on the audit server during testing. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE is capable of transferring audit data to an external audit server automatically without administrator intervention.
.. Test 2: For distributed TOEs, Test 1 defined above shall be applicable to all TOE components that forward audit data to an external audit server.
.. Test 3: The evaluator shall perform operations that generate audit data and verify that this data is stored locally. The evaluator shall then make note of whether the TSS claims persistent or non-persistent logging and perform one of the following actions:
[lowerroman]
... If persistent logging is selected, the evaluator shall perform a power cycle of the TOE and ensure that following power on operations the log events generated are still maintained within the local audit storage.
... If non-persistent logging is selected, the evaluator shall perform a power cycle of the TOE and ensure that following power on operations the log events generated are no longer present within the local audit storage.
[loweralpha, start=4]
.. Test 4: The evaluator shall perform operations that generate audit data until the local storage space is exceeded and verifies that the TOE complies with the behaviour defined in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5. Depending on the configuration this means that the evaluator shall check the content of the audit data when the audit data is just filled to the maximum and then verifies that:
[lowerroman]
...	The audit data remains unchanged with every new auditable event that should be tracked but that the audit data is recorded again after the local storage for audit data is cleared (for the option ‘drop new audit data’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5).
... The existing audit data is overwritten with every new auditable event that should be tracked according to the specified rule (for the option ‘overwrite previous audit records’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5)
...	The TOE behaves as specified (for the option ‘other action’ in FAU_STG_EXT.1.5).
[loweralpha, start=5]
.. Test 5: For distributed TOEs, for the local storage according to FAU_STG_EXT.1.4, Test 1 specified above shall be applied to all TOE components that store audit data locally. For all TOE components that store audit data locally and comply with FAU_STG_EXT.2, Test 2 specified above shall be applied. The evaluator shall verify that the transfer of audit data to an external audit server is implemented.
.. Test 6 [Conditional]: In case manual export or ability to view locally is selected in FAU_STG_EXT.1.6, during interruption the evaluator shall perform a TSF-mediated action and verify the event is recorded in the audit trail.
+
Note: The intent of the test is to ensure that the local audit TSF (as specified by FAU_STG_EXT.1.3) operates independently from the ability to transmit the generated audit data to an external audit server (as specified in FAU_STG_EXT.1.1). There are no specific requirements on the interruption of the connection between the TOE and the external audit server (as for FTP_ITC.1).

=== Cryptographic Support (FCS)

==== FCS_CKM.1/AKG Cryptographic Key Generation – Asymmetric Key

===== TSS
[arabic, start=50]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it describes how the TOE generates a key based on output from a random bit generator as specified in FCS_RBG.1. The evaluator shall review the TSS to verify that it describes how the functionality described by FCS_RBG.1 is invoked.

. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it identifies the usage and key lifecycle for keys generated using each selected algorithm.

. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that any one-time values such as nonces or masks are constructed in accordance with the relevant standards.

. If the TOE uses the generated key in a key chain or hierarchy then the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how the key is used as part of the key chain or hierarchy. 

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=54]
. The evaluator shall verify that the Guidance instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to generate keys for the selected key generation algorithms for all key types and uses identified in the TSS. 

===== Tests
[arabic, start=55]
. The following tests are conditional based on the selections made in the SFR. The evaluator shall perform the following tests or witness respective tests executed by the developer. The tests must be executed on a platform that is as close as practically possible to the operational platform (but which may be instrumented in terms of, for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is not carried out on the TOE itself, the test platform shall be identified and the differences between test environment and TOE execution environment shall be described.

*RSA Key Generation*

[arabic, start=56]
. FIPS PUB 186-5 Key Pair generation specifies five methods for generating the primes p and q. These are:
[loweralpha]
.. Random provable primes
.. Random probable primes
.. Provable primes with conditions based on auxiliary provable primes
.. Probable primes with conditions based on auxiliary provable primes
.. Probable primes with conditions based on auxiliary probable primes

In addition to the key generation method, the input parameters are:

[loweralpha, start=2]
* Modulus [3072, 4096, 6144, 8192]
* Hash algorithm [SHA-384, SHA-512] (methods 1, 3, 4 only)
* Rabin-Miller prime test [2100, 2Security String] (methods 2, 4, 5 only)
* p mod 8 value [0,1,3,5,7]
* q mod 8 value [0,1,3,5,7]
* Private key format [standard, Chinese Remainder Theorem]
* Public exponent [fixed value, random]

The evaluator shall verify the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values for the RSA key components, including the public verification exponent e, the private prime factors p and q, the public modulus n, and the calculation of the private signature exponent d.

*Testing for Random Provable Primes and Conditional Methods*
[arabic, start=57]

. To test the key generation method for the random provable primes method and for all the primes with conditions methods (methods 1, 3-5), the evaluator must seed the TSF key generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the RSA key pair.  For each supported combination of the above input parameters, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated by a known good implementation using the same input parameters.

*Testing for Random Probable Primes Method*
[arabic, start=58]

. If the TOE generates random probable primes (method 2) then, if possible, the random probable primes method should also be verified against a known good implementation as described above. If verification against a known good implementation is not possible, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key pairs for each supported key length nlen and verify that all of the following are true.

[loweralpha]
* n = p*q
* p and q are probably prime according to Miller-Rabin tests with error probability <2(-125)
* 216 < e < 2256 and e is an odd integer
* GCD(p-1,e) = 1
* GCD(q-1,e) = 1
* |p-q| > 2(nlen/2 – 100)
* p ≥ squareroot(2)*( 2(nlen/2 -1) )
* q ≥ squareroot(2)*( 2(nlen/2 -1) )
* 2(nlen/2) < d < LCM(p-1,q-1)
* e*d = 1 mod LCM(p-1,q-1)

*Elliptic Curve Key Generation*

[arabic, start=59]
. To test the TOE’s ability to generate asymmetric cryptographic keys using elliptic curves, the evaluator shall perform the ECC Key Generation Test and the ECC Key Validation Test using the following input parameters:

.. Elliptic curve [P-256, P-384, P-521]
.. Key pair generation method [extra random bits, rejection sampling]

*ECC Key Generation Test*

[arabic, start=60]
. For each supported combination of the above input parameters the evaluator shall require the implementation under test to generate 10 private/public key pairs (d, Q). The private key, d, shall be generated using a random bit generator as specified in FCS_RBG.1. The private key, d, is used to compute the public key, Q’. The evaluator shall confirm that 0<d<n (where n is the order of the group), and the computed value Q’ is then compared to the generated public/private key pairs’ public key, Q, to confirm that Q is equal to Q’.

*ECC Key Validation Test*

[arabic, start=61]
. For each supported combination of the above parameters the evaluator shall generate 12 private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known-good implementation.

==== FCS_CKM.6 Timing and Event of Cryptographic Key Destruction

===== TSS
[arabic, start=76]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys (describing the origin and storage location of each), all relevant key destruction situations (e.g., factory reset or device wipe function, disconnection of trusted channels, key change as part of a secure channel protocol), and the destruction method used in each case. For the purpose of this Evaluation Activity the relevant keys are those keys that are relied upon to support any of the SFRs in the Security Target. The evaluator shall confirm that the description of keys and storage locations is consistent with the functions carried out by the TOE (e.g., that all keys for the TOE-specific secure channels and protocols, or that support FPT_APW.EXT.1 and FPT_SKP_EXT.1, are accounted forfootnote:[Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key, this may need to be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description of keys with the TOE functions.]). In particular, if a TOE claims not to store plaintext keys in non-volatile memory then the evaluator shall check that this is consistent with the operation of the TOE.
. The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS identifies how the TOE destroys keys stored as plaintext in non-volatile memory, and that the description includes identification and description of the interfaces that the TOE uses to destroy keys (e.g., file system APIs, key store APIs).
. Note that where selections involve ‘destruction of reference’ (for volatile memory) or ‘invocation of an interface’ (for non-volatile memory) then the relevant interface definition is examined by the evaluator to ensure that the interface supports the selection(s) and description in the TSS. In the case of non-volatile memory, the evaluator includes in their examination the relevant interface description for each media type on which plaintext keys are stored. The presence of OS-level and storage device-level swap and cache files is not examined in the current version of the Evaluation Activity.
. Where the TSS identifies keys that are stored in a non-plaintext form, the evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies the encryption method and the key-encrypting-key used, and that the key-encrypting-key is either itself stored in an encrypted form or that it is destroyed by a method included under FCS_CKM.6.
. The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further discussion in the Guidance Documentation section below). Note that reference may be made to the Guidance Documentation for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or delayed.
. Where the ST specifies the use of “a static or dynamic value that does not contain any CSP” to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=82]
. A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS (and any other supporting information used). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer.
. For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing wear-levelling and garbage collection. This may result in additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM commandfootnote:[Where TRIM is used then the TSS and/or guidance documentation is/are also expected to describe how the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g., they would need not to be contained in a file of size less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the master file table).] and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their deletion (this would be explained in the TSS and Operational Guidance).

===== Tests

==== FCS_CKM_EXT.7 Cryptographic Key Agreement

===== TSS
[arabic, start=85]

. The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS documents that the security strength of the material contributed by the TOE is sufficient for the security strength of the key and the agreement method. 

. The intent of this activity is to be able to identify the scheme being used by each service. This would mean, for example, one way to document scheme usage could be as shown in the table below. The information provided in this example does not necessarily have to be included as a table but can be presented in other ways as long as the necessary data is available. The relevant SFR citation may come from a functional package if the TOE boundary includes any functional packages that define uses of key establishment schemes. For example, FCS_TLSS_EXT.1 is referenced below, which would be appropriate if the TOE includes that SFR claim as part of conformance to the Functional Package for TLS.

===== Tests

*FCS_RBG.1.1*

[arabic, start=176]
. The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration.
. If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator shall verify that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly generated. “generate one block of random bits” means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP800-90A).
. If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator shall verify that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.
. The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to be generated/selected by the evaluator.

* *Entropy input:* the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.
* *Nonce:* If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length.
* *Personalization string:* The length of the personalization string must be ≤ seed length. If the implementation only supports one personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a personalization string, no value needs to be supplied.
* *Additional input:* the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.

.. Test 1: The evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the appropriate credential supported for the login method. For all combinations of supported credentials and login methods, the evaluator shall show that providing correct I&A information results in the ability to access the system, while providing incorrect information results in denial of access.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall configure the services allowed (if any) according to the guidance documentation, and then determine the services available to an external remote entity. The evaluator shall determine that the list of services available is limited to those specified in the requirement.
.. Test 3: For local access, the evaluator shall determine what services are available to a local administrator prior to logging in, and make sure this list is consistent with the requirement.
.. Test 4: For distributed TOEs, where not all TOE components support the authentication of Security Administrators according to FIA_UIA_EXT.1, the evaluator shall test that the components authenticate Security Administrators as described in the TSS.

=== Security management (FMT)

==== General Requirements for Distributed TOEs
For distributed TOEs, the evaluation activities defined in this chapter shall be performed.

===== TSS
[arabic, start=188]
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how every function related to security management is realized for every TOE component and shared between different TOE components. The evaluator shall confirm that all relevant aspects of each TOE component are covered by the FMT SFRs.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=189]
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall verify that the Guidance Documentation describes management of each TOE component. The evaluator shall confirm that all relevant aspects of each TOE component are covered by the FMT SFRs.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=190]
. Tests defined to verify the correct implementation of security management functions shall be performed for every TOE component. For security management functions that are implemented centrally, sampling should be applied when defining the evaluator’s tests (ensuring that all components are covered by the sample).

==== FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate Management of security functions behaviour

===== TSS
[arabic, start=191]
. For distributed TOEs, see Section 2.4.1.1. There are no specific requirements for non-distributed TOEs. 

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=192]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to determine that any necessary steps to perform manual update are described. The guidance documentation shall also provide warnings regarding functions that may cease to operate during the update (if applicable).
. For distributed TOEs, the guidance documentation shall describe all steps for how to update all TOE components. This shall contain a description of the order in which components need to be updated if the order is relevant to the update process. The guidance documentation shall also provide warnings regarding functions of TOE components and the overall TOE that may cease to operate during the update (if applicable).

===== Tests
[arabic, start=194]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall try to perform the update using a legitimate update image without prior authentication as Security Administrator (either by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all – depending on the configuration of the TOE). The attempt to update the TOE shall fail.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall try to perform the update with prior authentication as Security Administrator using a legitimate update image. This attempt should be successful. This test case is  covered by Test 1 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1.

==== FMT_MTD.1/CoreData Management of TSF Data

===== TSS
[arabic, start=195]
. For each administrative function identified in the guidance documentation that is accessible through an interface prior to administrator log-in, the evaluator shall confirm that the TSS details how the ability to manipulate the TSF data through these interfaces is disallowed for non-administrative users.
. If the TOE supports handling of X.509v3 certificates and implements a trust store, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it contains sufficient information to describe how the ability to manage the TOE’s trust store is restricted.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=197]
. The evaluator shall review the guidance documentation to determine that each of the TSF-data-manipulating functions implemented in response to the requirements of the cPP is identified, and that configuration information is provided to ensure that only administrators have access to the functions.
. If the TOE supports handling of X.509v3 certificates and provides a trust store, the evaluator shall review the guidance documentation to determine that it provides sufficient information for the administrator to configure and maintain the trust store in a secure way. If the TOE supports loading of CA certificates, the evaluator shall review the guidance documentation to determine that it provides sufficient information for the administrator to securely load CA certificates into the trust store. The evaluator shall also review the guidance documentation to determine that it explains how to designate a CA certificate a trust anchor.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=199]
. No separate testing for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData is required unless one of the management functions has not already been exercised under any other SFR.

==== FMT_SMF.1 Specification of Management Functions

[arabic, start=200]
. The security management functions for FMT_SMF.1 are distributed throughout the cPP and are included as part of the requirements in FTA_SSL_EXT.1, FTA_SSL.3, FTA_TAB.1, FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate, FMT_MOF.1/AutoUpdate (if included in the ST), FIA_AFL.1, FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2 & FPT_TUD_EXT.2.2 (if included in the ST and if an administrator-configurable action is included as per Application Note 65 of FPT_TUD_EXT.2.4 in the cPP), FMT_MOF.1/Services, and FMT_MOF.1/Functions (for all of these SFRs that are included in the ST), FMT_MTD, FPT_TST_EXT, and any cryptographic management functions specified in the reference standards. If the TOE claims conformance to the Functional Package for X.509, any management functions defined there are relevant to this SFR as well. Compliance to these requirements satisfies compliance with FMT_SMF.1.

===== TSS (containing also requirements on Guidance Documentation and Tests)
[arabic, start=201]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS and Guidance Documentation and confirm that each management function specified in FMT_SMF.1 is adequately described. The evaluator shall confirm that the TSS details which security management functions are available through the local and/or remote administration interfaces.
. [Conditional] The evaluator shall examine the TSS and Guidance Documentation to verify they both describe the local administrative interface. The evaluator shall ensure the Guidance Documentation includes appropriate warnings for the administrator to ensure the interface is local.
. For distributed TOEs, with the option 'ability to configure the interaction between TOE components' the evaluator shall examine that the ways to configure the interaction between TOE components is detailed in the TSS and Guidance Documentation. The evaluator shall check that the TOE behaviour observed during testing of the configured SFRs is as described in the TSS and Guidance Documentation.
. (If 'configure local audit' is selected) The evaluator shall examine the TSS and Guidance Documentation to ensure that a description of the logging implementation is described in enough detail to determine how log files are maintained on the TOE.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=205]
. See Section 2.4.4.1.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=206]
. The evaluator shall test management functions as part of testing the SFRs identified in Section 2.4.4. No separate testing for FMT_SMF.1 is required unless one of the management functions in FMT_SMF.1.1 has not already been exercised under any other SFR.

==== FMT_SMR.2 Restrictions on Security Roles

===== TSS
[arabic, start=207]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details the TOE supported roles and any restrictions of the roles involving administration of the TOE (e.g., if local administrators and remote administrators have different privileges, or if several types of administrators with different privileges are supported by the TOE).

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=208]
. The evaluator shall review the guidance documentation to ensure that it contains instructions for administering the TOE both locally and remotely, including any configuration that needs to be performed on the client for remote administration.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=209]
. In the course of performing the testing activities for the evaluation, the evaluator shall use all supported interfaces, although it is not necessary to repeat each test involving an administrative action with each interface. The evaluator shall ensure, however, that each supported method of administering the TOE that conforms to the requirements of this cPP be tested.

. For example, if the following are possible:
* direct connection if the TOE can be administered through a local hardware interface
* SSH if the TSF shall be validated against the Functional Package for Secure Shell referenced in Section 2.2 of the cPP
* TLS/HTTPS if the TSF has TLS implemented as defined in the Functional Package for TLS

then all three methods of administration must be exercised during the evaluation team’s test activities.

=== Protection of the TSF (FPT)

==== FPT_SKP_EXT.1 Protection of TSF Data (for Reading of All Symmetric Keys)

===== TSS
[arabic, start=211]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details how any preshared keys, symmetric keys, and private keys are stored and that they are unable to be viewed through any interface designed specifically for that purpose, by any enabled role, as outlined in the application note. If these values are not stored in plaintext, the TSS shall describe how they are protected/obscured.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=212]
. None

===== Tests
[arabic, start=213]
. None

==== FPT_STM_EXT.1 Reliable Time Stamps

===== TSS
[arabic, start=214]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it lists each security function that makes use of time, and that it provides a description of how the time is maintained and considered reliable in the context of each of the time related functions.
. If 'obtain time from the underlying virtualization system' is selected, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it identifies the Virtualization System (VS) interface the TOE uses to obtain time. If there is a delay between updates to the time on the VS and updating the time on the TOE, the TSS shall identify the maximum possible delay.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=216]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure it instructs the administrator how to set the time. If the TOE supports the use of an NTP server, the guidance documentation instructs how a communication path is established between the TOE and the NTP server, and any configuration of the NTP client on the TOE to support this communication.
. If the TOE supports obtaining time from the underlying VS, then the evaluator shall verify that the Guidance Documentation specifies any configuration steps necessary. If no configuration is necessary, then no statement is necessary in the Guidance Documentation. If there is a delay between updates to the time on the VS and updating the time on the TOE, then the evaluator shall ensure the Guidance Documentation informs the administrator of the maximum possible delay.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=218]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: If the TOE supports direct setting of the time by the Security Administrator, then the evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to set the time. The evaluator shall then use an available interface to observe that the time was set correctly.
.. Test 2: If the TOE supports the use of an NTP server, then the evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the NTP client on the TOE and set up a communication path with the NTP server. The evaluator shall observe that the NTP server has set the time to what is expected. If the TOE supports multiple protocols for establishing a connection with the NTP server, then the evaluator shall perform this test using each supported protocol claimed in the guidance documentation.
.. Test 3 [conditional]: If the TOE obtains time from the underlying VS, then the evaluator shall record the time on the TOE, modify the time on the underlying VS, and verify the modified time is reflected by the TOE. If there is a delay between setting the time on the VS and when the time is reflected on the TOE, then the evaluator shall ensure this delay is consistent with the TSS and Guidance.

[arabic, start=219]
. If the audit component of the TOE consists of several parts with independent time information, then the evaluator shall verify that the time information between the different parts are either synchronized or that it is possible for all audit information to relate the time information of the different part to one base information unambiguously.

==== FPT_TST_EXT.1 TSF Testing

===== TSS
[arabic, start=220]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it details each of the self-tests that are identified by the SFR; this description should include an outline of what the tests are actually doing (e.g., rather than saying "memory is tested", a description similar to "memory is tested by writing a value to each memory location and reading it back to ensure it is identical to what was written" shall be used). The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS makes an argument that the tests are sufficient to demonstrate that the TSF is operating correctly. If more than one failure response is listed in FPT_TST_EXT.1.2, then the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it clarifies which response is associated with which type of failure.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it details which TOE component performs which self-tests and when these self-tests are run. The evaluator shall also examine the TSS to ensure it describes how the TOE reacts if one or more TOE components fail self-testing (e.g., halting and displaying an error message; failover behaviour).

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=222]
. The evaluator shall also ensure that the guidance documentation describes the possible errors that may result from such tests, and actions the administrator should take in response; these possible errors shall correspond to those described in the TSS.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall ensure that the guidance documentation describes how to determine from an error message returned which TOE component has failed the self-test.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=224]
. It is expected that at least the following tests are performed:
[loweralpha]
.. Verification of the integrity of the firmware and executable software of the TOE.
.. Verification of the correct operation of the cryptographic functions necessary to fulfil any of the SFRs.
[arabic, start=225]
. Although formal compliance is not mandated, the self-tests performed should aim for a level of confidence comparable to:
[loweralpha]
.. [FIPS 140-2], Section 4.9.1, Software/firmware integrity test for the verification of the integrity of the firmware and executable software. Note that the testing is not restricted to the cryptographic functions of the TOE.
.. [FIPS 140-2], Section 4.9.1, Cryptographic algorithm test for the verification of the correct operation of cryptographic functions. Alternatively, national requirements of any CCRA member state for the security evaluation of cryptographic functions should be considered as appropriate.

.. [FIPS 140-3] ([ISO/IEC 19790:2015]), Section 7.10.2.2, Software/firmware integrity test for the verification of the integrity of the firmware and executable software. Note that the testing is not restricted to the cryptographic functions of the TOE.

.. [ISO/IEC 19790:2025], Section 7.10.3.2, Pre-operational software/firmware integrity test. Verification using an approved integrity technique. Note that the testing is not restricted to the cryptographic functions of the TOE.


[arabic, start=226]
. The evaluator shall verify that the self-tests described above are carried out according to the SFR and in agreement with the descriptions in the TSS.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall perform testing of self-tests on all TOE components according to the description in the TSS about which self-tests are performed by which component.

==== FPT_TUD_EXT.1 Trusted Update

===== TSS
[arabic, start=228]
. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how to query the currently active version. If a trusted update can be installed on the TOE with a delayed activation, the TSS shall describe how and when the inactive version becomes active. The evaluator shall verify this description.
. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes all TSF software update mechanisms for updating the system firmware and software (for simplicity the term 'software' will be used in the following although the requirements apply to firmware and software). The evaluator shall verify that the description includes the method used to authenticate the update, including either digital-signature verification or X.509 certificate-based verification when selected in FPT_TUD_EXT.1. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how candidate updates are obtained, the processing performed to authenticate the update, and the actions taken for both successful and unsuccessful authentication.

. If the options ‘support automatic checking for updates’ or ‘support automatic updates’ are chosen from the selections in FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS explains what actions are involved in automatic checking or automatic updating by the TOE, respectively.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes how all TOE components are updated, that it describes all mechanisms that support continuous proper functioning of the TOE during update (when applying updates separately to individual TOE components) and how verification of the signature is performed for each TOE component.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=232]
. The evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation describes how to query the currently active version. If a trusted update can be installed on the TOE with a delayed activation, the guidance documentation shall describe how to query the loaded but inactive version.
. The evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation describes how the verification of the authenticity of the update is performed (digital signature verification). The description shall include the procedures for successful and unsuccessful verification. The description shall correspond to the description in the TSS.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation describes how the versions of individual TOE components are determined for FPT_TUD_EXT.1, how all TOE components are updated, and the error conditions that may arise from checking or applying the update (e.g., failure of signature verification, or exceeding available storage space) along with appropriate recovery actions. The guidance documentation only has to describe the procedures relevant for the Security Administrator; it does not need to give information about the internal communication (amongst TOE components) that takes place when applying updates.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the Guidance Documentation to ensure that it describes how all TOE components are updated, that it describes all mechanisms that support continuous proper functioning of the TOE during update (when applying updates separately to individual TOE components) and how verification of the signature is performed for each TOE component.
. If the ST author indicates that a certificate-based mechanism is used for software update digital signature verification, the evaluator shall verify that the Guidance Documentation contains a description of how the certificates are contained on the device. The evaluator shall also ensure that the Guidance Documentation describes how the certificates are installed/updated/selected, if necessary.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=237]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall perform the version verification activity to determine the current version of the product. If a trusted update can be installed on the TOE with a delayed activation, the evaluator shall also query the most recently installed version (for this test the TOE shall be in a state where these two versions match). The evaluator will obtain a legitimate update using procedures described in the guidance documentation and verify that it has been successfully installed on the TOE. For some TOEs loading the update onto the TOE and activation of the update are separate steps (‘activation’ could be performed e.g., by a distinct activation step or by rebooting the device). In that case, the evaluator shall verify after loading the update onto the TOE but before activation of the update that the current version of the product did not change but the most recently installed version has changed to the new product version. After the update, the evaluator shall perform the version verification activity again to verify the version correctly corresponds to that of the update and that current version of the product and most recently installed version match again.
.. Test 2: If the TOE itself verifies a digital signature in order to authorise the installation of an image to update the TOE, the following test shall be performed (otherwise the test shall be omitted). The evaluator shall first confirm that no updates are pending and then perform the version verification activity to determine the current version of the product, verifying that it is different from the version claimed in the update(s) to be used in this test. The evaluator shall obtain or produce illegitimate updates as defined below and attempt to install them on the TOE. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE rejects all of the illegitimate updates. The evaluator shall perform this test using all of the following forms of illegitimate updates:
[lowerroman]
... A modified version (e.g., using a hex editor) of a legitimately signed update
... An image that has not been signed
... An otherwise valid image with a properly formed signature that was signed by an unknown key. The purpose of this test is to verify the TOE would only accept images signed by an explicitly trusted key (or a key associated with a trusted certificate).
... The handling of version information of the most recently installed version might differ between different TOEs depending on the point in time when an attempted update is rejected. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE handles the most recently installed version information for that case as described in the guidance documentation. After the TOE has rejected the update, the evaluator shall verify that both the current version and most recently installed version reflect the same version information as prior to the update attempt.
[loweralpha, start=3]
[arabic, start=238]
. The evaluator shall perform Test 1 and Test 2  for all supported methods (manual updates, automatic checking for updates, automatic updates).
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall perform Test 1 and Test 2 for all TOE components.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=245]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1 [conditional]: If the TOE supports local administration, the evaluator shall initiate an interactive local session with the TOE. The evaluator shall then follow the guidance documentation to exit or log off the session and observe that the session has been terminated.
.. Test 2: For each method of remote administration, the evaluator shall initiate an interactive remote session with the TOE. The evaluator shall then follow the guidance documentation to exit or log off the session and observe that the session has been terminated.

==== FTA_TAB.1 Default TOE Access Banners

===== TSS
[arabic, start=246]
. The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that it details each administrative method of access (local and/or remote) available to the Security Administrator (e.g., serial port, SSH, HTTPS). The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that all administrative methods of access available to the Security Administrator are listed and that the TSS states that the TOE is displaying an advisory notice and a consent warning message for each administrative method of access. The advisory notice and the consent warning message may be different for different administrative methods of access and may be configured during initial configuration (e.g., via a configuration file).

==== FTP_ITC.1 Inter-TSF Trusted Channel

===== TSS
[arabic, start=249]

The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that, for all communications with authorised IT entities identified in the requirement, each secure communication mechanism is identified in terms of the allowed protocols for that IT entity, whether the TOE acts as a server or a client, and the method of assured identification of the non-TSF endpoint. The evaluator shall also confirm that all secure communication mechanisms are described in sufficient detail to allow the evaluator to match them to the cryptographic protocol SFRs listed in the ST.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=250]
. The evaluator shall confirm that the guidance documentation contains instructions for establishing the allowed protocols with each authorised IT entity, and that it contains recovery instructions should a connection be unintentionally broken.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=251]
. The developer shall provide to the evaluator application layer configuration settings for all secure communication mechanisms specified by the FTP_ITC.1 requirement. This information should be sufficiently detailed to allow the evaluator to determine the application layer timeout settings for each cryptographic protocol. There is no expectation that this information must be recorded in any public-facing document or report.
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall ensure that communications using each protocol with each authorised IT entity is tested during the course of the evaluation, setting up each connection as described in the guidance documentation and ensuring that communication is successful.
.. Test 2: For each protocol that the TOE can initiate as defined in the requirement, the evaluator shall follow the guidance documentation to ensure that the communication channel can in fact be initiated from the TOE.
.. Test 3: The evaluator shall verify that, for each communication channel with an authorised IT entity, the channel data is not sent in plaintext.
.. Test 4: Objective: The objective of this test is to ensure that the TOE reacts appropriately to any connection outage or interruption of the route to the external IT entities.
+
The evaluator shall, for each instance where the TOE acts as a client using a secure communication mechanism with a distinct IT entity, interrupt the connection of that IT entity for: i) a duration that exceeds the TOE’s application layer timeout setting, ii) a duration shorter than the application layer timeout but of sufficient length to interrupt the network link layer.  
+
The evaluator shall ensure that, when the connectivity is restored, communications are appropriately protected and no TSF data is sent in plaintext.  
+
In the case where the TOE is able to detect TOE external interruption (such as a cable being physically removed or a virtual connection being disabled), another network device shall be used to interrupt the connection between the TOE and the distinct IT entity. The interruption shall be external to the TOE (i.e., by manipulating the test environment and not by TOE configuration change).

[arabic, start=253]
. Further assurance activities are associated with the specific protocols.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall perform tests on all TOE components according to the mapping of external secure channels to TOE components in the Security Target.
. The developer shall provide to the evaluator application layer configuration settings for all secure communication mechanisms specified by the FTP_ITC.1 requirement. This information should be sufficiently detailed to allow the evaluator to determine the application layer timeout settings for each cryptographic protocol. There is no expectation that this information must be recorded in any public- facing document or report.

==== FTP_TRP.1/Admin Trusted Path

===== TSS
[arabic, start=256]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that the remote TOE administration methods are indicated, along with how those communications are protected.

== Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements

=== Security Audit (FAU)

==== FAU_STG.2 Protected audit data storage

===== TSS
[arabic, start=261]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the amount of audit data stored locally and how it is protected against unauthorised modification or deletion. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the conditions that must be met for authorised deletion of audit records.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes to which TOE components this SFR applies and how local storage is implemented among the different TOE components (e.g., every TOE component either provides its own local storage, or the data is sent to another TOE component for central local storage of all audit events).

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=263]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to determine if it describes any configuration required for protection of the locally stored audit data against unauthorised modification or deletion.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=264]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall attempt to access the audit trail without authentication as a Security Administrator (either by authentication as a non-administrative user, if supported, or without authentication at all) and attempt to modify and delete the audit records. The evaluator shall verify that these attempts fail.
+
In the case that no other users than the Security Administrator can be defined, without user authentication the user may not be able to get to the point where the attempt to access the audit trail can be executed. In this case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall access the audit trail as an authenticated Security Administrator and attempt to delete the audit records (if supported by the TOE, and to the extent described in the TSS). The evaluator shall verify that these attempts succeed. The evaluator shall verify that only the records authorised for deletion are deleted.
[arabic, start=265]
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall perform test 1 and test 2 for each component that is defined by the TSS to be covered by this SFR.

==== FAU_STG_EXT.2 Counting Lost Audit Data

[arabic, start=266]
. This activity should be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of FAU_STG_EXT.1.4 and FAU_STG_EXT.1.5.

===== TSS
[arabic, start=267]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it details the possible options the TOE supports for information about the number of audit records that have been dropped, overwritten, etc. when the local storage for audit data is full.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes to which TOE components this SFR applies. Since this SFR is optional, it might only apply to some TOE components and not all. This might lead to the situation where all TOE components store their audit information themselves but FAU_STG_EXT.2 is supported only by one of the components.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=269]
. The evaluator shall also ensure that the guidance documentation describes all possible configuration options and the meaning of the result returned by the TOE for each possible configuration.

. The evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation contains a warning for the administrator about the loss of audit data when clearing the local storage for audit records.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=271]
. The evaluator shall verify that the numbers provided by the TOE according to the selection for FAU_STG_EXT.2 are correct when performing the tests for FAU_STG_EXT.1.5.

===== TSS
[arabic, start=274]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it details how the Security Administrator is warned before the local storage for audit data is full.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes to which TOE components this SFR applies and how each TOE component implements this SFR. Since this SFR is optional, it might only apply to some TOE components and not all. This might lead to the situation where all TOE components store their audit information themselves but FAU_STG_EXT.3 is supported only by one of the components. In particular, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes for every component supporting this functionality, whether the warning is generated by the component itself or through another component and name the corresponding component in the latter case. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS makes clear any situations in which audit records might be 'invisibly lost'.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=276]
. The evaluator shall also verify that the guidance documentation describes how the Security Administrator is warned before the local storage for audit data is full and how this warning is displayed or stored (since there is no guarantee that an administrator session is running at the time the warning is issued, it is very likely that it will be stored in the log files). The description in the guidance documentation shall correspond to the description in the TSS.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=277]
. The evaluator shall verify that a warning is issued by the TOE before the local storage space for audit data is full.
. For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall verify the correct implementation of display warning for local storage space for all TOE components that are supporting this feature according to the description in the TSS. The evaluator shall verify that each component that supports this feature according to the description in the TSS is capable of generating a warning itself or through another component.

==== FCS_CKM.2 Cryptographic Key Distribution

===== TSS
[arabic, start=279]
. The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS documents that the security strength supported by the selected key distribution methods is sufficient for the security strength of the keys distributed through those methods.
. It is not necessary to identify the services that use each key distribution method here. That information should be documented in the requirements for the individual services and protocols that invoke key distribution.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=281]
. The evaluator shall verify that the AGD guidance instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to use the selected key distribution methods. 

===== Tests
[arabic, start=282]
. Specific testing for this component is covered by testing for the claimed components in FCS_COP.1/KeyEncap, FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, or FPT_ITT.1.

=== Protection of the TSF (FPT)

==== FPT_ITT.1 Basic Internal TSF Data Transfer Protection

[arabic, start=283]
. If the TOE is not a distributed TOE, then no evaluator action is necessary. For a distributed TOE the evaluator carries out the activities below.

===== TSS
[arabic, start=284]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that, for all communications between components of a distributed TOE, each communications mechanism is identified in terms of the allowed protocols for  inter-component communication. The evaluator shall also confirm that all protocols listed in the TSS for these inter-component communications are specified and included in the requirements in the ST.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=285]
. The evaluator shall confirm that the guidance documentation contains instructions for establishing the relevant allowed communication channels and protocols between each pair of authorised TOE components, and that it contains recovery instructions should a connection be unintentionally broken.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=286]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall ensure that each communications channel established using each protocol between each pair of distributed TOE components is tested during the course of the evaluation, setting up the connections as described in the guidance documentation and verifying that communication is successful.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall verify that for each communication channel established between distributed TOE components, the channel data is not sent in plaintext.
.. Test 3: Objective: This test is to ensure that the TOE reacts appropriately to any connection outage or interruption of the route between distributed TOE components.
+
The evaluator shall ensure that, for each different pair of non-equivalent TOE component types, the connection is physically interrupted for the following durations: i) a duration that exceeds the TOE’s application layer timeout setting, ii) a duration that is shorter than the application layer timeout but is of sufficient length to interrupt the network link layer.
+
The evaluator shall verify that when physical connectivity is restored between distributed TOE components, either communications are appropriately protected, or the secure channel is terminated and the registration process (as described in the FTP_TRP.1/Join) is re-initiated, with the TOE generating adequate warnings to alert the Security Administrator.
+
In the case that the TOE is able to detect when the cable is removed from the device, another physical network device (e.g., a core switch) shall be used to interrupt the connection between the components.
+
For a non-virtualized TOE, the interruption shall not be performed at the virtual node (e.g., virtual switch) and must be physical in nature.

. Further assurance activities are associated with the specific protocols identified in the ST.

=== Trusted Path/Channels (FTP)

==== FTP_TRP.1/Join Trusted Path

===== TSS
[arabic, start=288]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that the methods of joining components to the TOE are identified, along with how communications with those newly-joined components are protected, including identification of whether the environment is required to provide confidentiality of the communications or whether the registration data exchanged does not require confidentiality. If the TSS asserts that registration data does not require confidentiality protection, then the evaluator shall examine the justification provided to confirm that.
. The evaluator shall also check that all protocols listed in the TSS in support of this process are included in the SFRs in the ST, and that if the ST uses FTP_TRP.1/Join for the registration channel then this channel cannot be reused as the normal inter-component communication channel (the latter channel must meet FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1).
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm that sufficient information is provided to determine the TOE actions in the case that the initial component joining attempt fails.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=291]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to confirm that it contains instructions for establishing and using the enablement and registration channel. The evaluator shall confirm that the guidance documentation clarifies which TOE component initiates the communication. The evaluator shall confirm that the guidance documentation contains recovery instructions should a connection be unintentionally broken during the registration process.
. In the case of a distributed TOE that relies on the operational environment to provide security for some aspects of the registration channel security, there are particular requirements on the Preparative Procedures as listed below. (Reliance on the operational environment in this way is indicated in an ST by a reference to operational guidance in the assignment in FTP_TRP.1.3/Join.) In this case the evaluator shall examine the Preparative Procedures to confirm that they:
[loweralpha]
.. Clearly state the strength of the authentication and encryption provided by the registration channel itself and the specific requirements on the environment used for joining TOE components to the distributed TOE (e.g., where the environment is relied upon to prevent interception of sensitive messages, IP spoofing attempts, man-in-the-middle attacks, or race conditions).
.. Identify what confidential values are transmitted over the enablement channel (e.g., any keys, their lengths, and their purposes), use of any non-confidential keys (e.g., where a developer uses the same key for more than one device or across all devices of a type or family), and use of any unauthenticated identification data (e.g., IP addresses, self-signed certificates).
.. Highlight any situation in which a secret value/key may be transmitted over a channel that uses a key of lower comparable strength than the transmitted value/key. Comparable strength is defined as the amount of work required to compromise the algorithm or key and is typically expressed as ‘bits’ of security. The ST author and evaluator shall consult NIST 800-57 Table 2 for further guidance on comparable algorithm strength.
+


===== Tests
[arabic, start=293]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall ensure that the communications path for joining components to the TSF is tested for each distinct (non-equivalent) component typefootnote:[The intention here is to cover all different software sections involved. For example, a single software image may be installed on different TOE components, but with different sections of the image executed according to the hardware platform or communications stack. In such as case tests should be carried out for each different software section.], setting up the connections as described in the guidance documentation and verifying that communication is successful. In particular the evaluator shall confirm that requirements on environment protection for the registration process are consistent with observations made on the test configuration (for example, a requirement to isolate the TOE components from the Internet during registration might be inconsistent with the need for a TOE component to contact a license server). If no requirements on the registration environment are identified as necessary to protect confidentiality, then the evaluator shall confirm that the key used for registration can be configured (following the instructions in the guidance documentation) to be at least the same length as the key used for the internal TSF channel that is being enabled. The evaluator shall confirm that the key used for the channel is unique to the pair of TOE components (this is done by identifying the relevant key during the registration test: it is not necessary to examine the key value).
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall follow the guidance documentation to ensure that the communication channel can be enabled by a Security Administrator for all the TOE components identified in the guidance documentation as capable of having the Security Administrator initiate the channel.
.. Test 3: The evaluator shall ensure that if the guidance documentation states that the channel data is encrypted, then the data observed on the channel is not plaintext.
[arabic, start=294]
. Further assurance activities are associated with the specific protocols.

=== Communication (FCO)

==== FCO_CPC_EXT.1 Component Registration Channel Definition

[arabic, start=295]
. If the TOE is not a distributed TOE, then no evaluator action is necessary. For a distributed TOE the evaluator carries out the activities below. In carrying out these activities the evaluator shall determine answers to the following questions based on a combination of documentation analysis and testing (possibly also using input from carrying out the Evaluation Activities for the relevant registration channel, such as FTP_TRP.1/Join), and shall report the answers.
[loweralpha]
.. What stopsfootnote:[The intent of the phrasing “what stops…” as opposed to “what secures…” is for the evaluator to pursue the answer to its lowest level of dependency, i.e., a level at which the security can clearly be seen to depend on things that are under appropriate control. For example, a channel may be protected by a public key that is provided to the relying party in a self-signed certificate. This enables cryptographic mechanisms to be applied to provide authentication (and therefore invites an answer that “the check on the public key certificate secures…”), but does not ultimately stop an attacker from apparently authenticating because the attacker can produce their own self-signed certificate. The question “what stops an unauthorised component from successfully communicating…” focuses attention on what an attacker needs to do, and therefore pushes the answer down to the level of whether a self-signed certificate could be produced by an attacker. Similarly, a well-known key, or a key that is common to a type of device rather than an individual device, may be used in a confidentiality mechanism but does not provide confidentiality because an attacker can find the well-known key or obtain his own instance of a device containing the non-unique key.] a TOE component from successfully communicating with other TOE components (in a way that enables it to participate as part of the TOE) before it has been properly authenticated and becomes a functional part of the distributed TOE?
.. What is the enablement step? (Describe what interface it uses, with a reference to the relevant section and step in the operational guidance).
[lowerroman]
... What stops anybody other than a Security Administrator from carrying out this step?
... How does the Security Administrator know that they are enabling the intended TOE component to join? (Identification of the joiner might be part of the enablement action itself or might be part of secure channel establishment, but it must prevent unintended joining of components)
[loweralpha, start=2]
.. What stops a TOE component from successfully joining if the Security Administrator has not carried out the enablement step; or, equivalently, how does the distributed TOE ensure that an action by an authentic Security Administrator is required before a component can successfully join?
.. What stops a TOE component from carrying out the registration process over a different, insecure channel?
.. If the FTP_TRP.1/Join channel type is selected in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2 then how does the registration process, and its resulting secure channel, ensure that the transmitted data is protected from disclosure and that it provides detection of modification?
.. Where the registration channel does not rely on protection of the registration environment, does the registration channel provide a sufficient level of protection (especially with regard to confidentiality) for the data that passes over it?
.. Where the registration channel is subsequently used for normal internal communication between TOE components (i.e. after the joiner has completed registration), do any of the authentication or encryption features of the registration channel result in use of a channel that has weaker protection than the normal FPT_ITT.1 requirements for such a channel?
.. What is the disablement step? (Describe what interface it uses, with a reference to the relevant section and step in the operational guidance).
.. What stops a TOE component from successfully communicating with other TOE components if the Security Administrator has carried out the disablement step?

===== TSS
[arabic, start=296]
. (Note: Section 3.4.1 lists questions for which the evaluator shall determine and report answers through the combination of the TSS, Guidance Documentation, and Tests Evaluation Activities.)
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm that it:
[loweralpha]
.. Describes the method by which a Security Administrator enables and disables communications between pairs of TOE components.
.. Describes the relevant details according to the type of channel in the main selection made in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2:
* First type: the TSS identifies the relevant SFR iteration that specifies the type of channel being used
* Second type: the TSS (with support from the operational guidance if selected in FTP_TRP.1.3/Join) provides details of the channel and the mechanisms that it uses (and describes how the process ensures that the key is unique to the pair of components) – see also the Evaluation Activities for FTP_TRP.1/Join.
[arabic, start=298]
. The evaluator shall verify that if any aspects of the registration channel are identified as not meeting FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1, then the ST has also selected the FTP_TRP.1/Join option in the main selection in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2. If the registration channel is also to be used for other communications then FTP_TRP.1/Join cannot be present in the ST.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=299]
. (Note: Section 3.4.1 lists questions for which the evaluator shall determine and report answers through the combination of the TSS, Guidance Documentation, and Tests Evaluation Activities.)
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to confirm that it contains instructions for enabling and disabling communications with any individual component of a distributed TOE. The evaluator shall confirm that the method of disabling is such that all other components will be prevented from communicating with the component that is being removed from the TOE (preventing the remaining components from either attempting to initiate communications with the disabled component, or from responding to communications from the disabled component).
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to confirm that it includes recovery instructions should a connection between TOE components be unintentionally broken during the registration process.
. If the TOE uses a registration channel for registering components to the TOE (i.e., where the ST author uses the FTP_ITC.1/FPT_ITT.1 or FTP_TRP.1/Join channel types in the main selection for FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2) then the evaluator shall examine the Preparative Procedures to confirm that they:
[loweralpha]
.. describe the security characteristics of the registration channel (e.g., the protocol, keys and authentication data on which it is based) and that they highlight any aspects which do not meet the requirements for a steady-state inter-component channel (as in FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1)
.. identify any dependencies between the configuration of the registration channel and the security of the subsequent inter-component communications (e.g., where AES-256 inter-component communications depend on transmitting 256-bit keys between components and therefore rely on the registration channel being configured to use an encryption key of equivalent length)
.. identify any aspects of the channel that can be modified by the operational environment in order to improve the channel's security, and that they describe how this modification can be achieved (e.g., generating a new key pair, or replacing a default public key certificate).
. As background for the examination of the registration channel description, it is noted that the requirements above are intended to ensure that administrators can make an accurate judgement of any risks that arise from the default registration process. Examples would be the use of self-signed certificates (i.e., certificates that are not chained to an external or local Certification Authority), manufacturer-issued certificates (where control over aspects such as revocation, or which devices are issued with recognised certificates, is outside the control of the operational environment), use of generic/non-unique keys (e.g., where the same key is present on more than one instance of a device), or well-known keys (i.e., where the confidentiality of the keys is not intended to be strongly protected – note that this need not mean there is a positive action or intention to publicise the keys).
. In the case of a distributed TOE for which the ST author uses the FTP_TRP.1/Join channel type in the main selection for FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2 and the TOE relies on the operational environment to provide security for some aspects of the registration channel security then there are additional requirements on the Preparative Procedures as described in Section 3.4.1.2.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=305]
. (Note: Section 3.4.1 lists questions for which the evaluator shall determine and report answers through the combination of the TSS, Guidance Documentation, and Tests Evaluation Activities.)
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1a: the evaluator shall confirm that a TOE component that is not currently a member of the distributed TOE cannot communicate with any other component of the TOE until the non-member is enabled by a Security Administrator, for each of the non-equivalent TOE componentsfootnote:[An ‘equivalent TOE component’ is a type of distributed TOE component that exhibits the same security characteristics, behaviour and role in the TSF as some other TOE component. In principle a distributed TOE could operate with only one instance of each equivalent TOE component, although the minimum configuration of the distributed TOE may include more than one instance (see discussion of the minimum configuration of a distributed TOE, in Appendix B.4). In practice a deployment of the TOE may include more than one instance of some equivalent TOE components for practical reasons, such as performance or the need to have separate instances for separate subnets or VLANs.], that it is required to communicate with (non-equivalent TOE components are as defined in the minimum configuration for the distributed TOE).
.. Test 1b: the evaluator shall confirm that after enablement, a TOE component can only communicate with the other TOE components that it has been enabled for. This includes testing that the enabled communication is successful for the enabled TOE component pair, and that communication remains unsuccessful with any other TOE component for which communication has not been explicitly enabled.
+
Some TOEs may set up the registration channel before the enablement step is carried out, but in such a case the separate registered-components channel must not allow communications until after the enablement step has been completed.
+
[arabic, start=307]
. The evaluator shall repeat Tests 1a and 1b for each different type of enablement process that can be used in the distributed TOE.
[loweralpha, start=3]
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall separately disable each TOE component in turn and ensure that the other TOE components cannot then communicate with the disabled component, whether by attempting to initiate communications with the disabled component, or by responding to communication attempts from the disabled component.
.. Test 3: The evaluator shall perform the following tests according to those that apply to the values of the main (outer) selection made in the ST for FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2.
[lowerroman]
... If the ST uses the first type of communication channel in the selection list in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2 then the evaluator shall test the channel via the Evaluation Activities for FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1 according to the second selection list in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2 (which is contained within the first type), therefore the evaluator shall ensure that the test coverage for these SFRs includes their usage in the registration process.
... If the ST uses the second type of communication channel in the selection in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2 then the evaluator shall test the channel via the Evaluation Activities for FTP_TRP.1/Join.
... If the ST uses the ‘no channel’ selection, then no test is required.
[loweralpha, start=5]
.. Test 4: The evaluator shall perform one of the following tests, according to the TOE characteristics identified in its TSS and operational guidance:
[lowerroman]
... If the registration channel is not subsequently used for inter-component communication, and in all cases where the second selection in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2 is made (i.e., using FTP_TRP.1/Join) then the evaluator shall confirm that the registration channel can no longer be used after the registration process has completed, by attempting to use the channel to communicate with each of the endpoints after registration has completed.
... If the registration channel is subsequently used for inter-component communication then the evaluator shall confirm that any aspects identified in the operational guidance as necessary to meet the requirements for a steady-state inter-component channel (as in FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1) can indeed be carried out (e.g., there might be a requirement to replace the default key pair and/or public key certificate). 
[loweralpha, start=6]
.. Test 5: For each aspect of the security of the registration channel that operational guidance states can be modified by the operational environment in order to improve the channel security (see AGD_PRE.1 refinement item 2 in (see the requirements on Preparative Procedures in 3.4.1.2), the evaluator shall confirm, by following the procedure described in the operational guidance, that this modification can be successfully carried out.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=310]
. The evaluator shall verify that the audit records provide all of the information specified in FAU_GEN.1 and that this information is suitable for human interpretation. The evaluation activity for this requirement is performed in conjunction with the evaluation activity for FAU_GEN.1.  

==== FAU_GEN_EXT.1 Security Audit Data Generation for Distributed TOE Components

[arabic, start=311]
. For distributed TOEs, the requirements on TSS, Guidance Documentation and Tests regarding FAU_GEN_EXT.1 are already covered by the corresponding requirements for FAU_GEN.1.

===== TSS
[arabic, start=312]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm that it describes which TOE components store their security audit events locally and which send their security audit events to other TOE components for local storage. For the latter, the target TOE component(s) which store security audit events for other TOE components shall be identified. For every sending TOE component, the corresponding receiving TOE component(s) need to be identified. For every transfer of audit information between TOE components it shall be described how the data is secured during transfer according to FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1.
. For each TOE component which does not store audit events locally by itself, the evaluator shall confirm that the TSS describes how the audit information is buffered before sending to another TOE component for local storage.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=314]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure that it describes how the link between different TOE components is established if audit data is exchanged between TOE components for local storage. The guidance documentation shall describe all possible configuration options for local storage of audit data and provide all instructions how to perform the related configuration of the TOE components.
. The evaluator shall also ensure that the guidance documentation describes for every TOE component which does not store audit information locally how audit information is buffered before transmission to other TOE components.

===== Tests

[arabic, start=316]
. For at least one of each type of distributed TOE components (sensors, central nodes, etc.), the following tests shall be performed using distributed TOEs.
[loweralpha, start=1]
.. Test 1: For each type of TOE component, the evaluator shall perform a representative subset of auditable actions and ensure that these actions cause the generation of appropriately formed audit records. Generation of such records can be observed directly on the distributed TOE component (if there is an appropriate interface), or indirectly after transmission to a central audit log storage location.
.. Test 2: For each type of TOE component that, in the evaluated configuration, is capable of transmitting audit information to the external audit server (as specified in FTP_ITC.1), the evaluator shall configure a trusted channel and confirm that audit records generated as a result of actions taken by the evaluator are securely transmitted to the external audit server. It is sufficient to observe negotiation and establishment of the secure channel with the TOE component and the subsequent transmission of encrypted data to confirm this functionality. Alternatively, the following steps shall be performed: The evaluator shall induce audit record transmission, then review the packet capture around the time of transmission and verify that no audit data has been transmitted in the clear.
.. Test 3: For each type of TOE component that, in the evaluated configuration, is capable of transmitting audit information to another TOE component (as specified in FTP_ITT.1 or FTP_ITC.1, respectively), the evaluator shall configure a secure channel and confirm that audit records generated as a result of actions taken by the evaluator have been securely transmitted. It is sufficient to observe negotiation and establishment of the secure channel with the TOE component and the subsequent transmission of encrypted data to confirm this functionality. Alternatively, the following steps shall be performed: The evaluator shall induce audit record transmission, then review the packet capture around the time of transmission and verify that no audit data is transmitted in the clear.
. While performing these tests, the evaluator shall verify that the TOE behaviour observed during testing is consistent with the descriptions provided in the TSS and the Guidance Documentation. Depending on the TOE configuration, there might be a large number of different possible configurations. In such cases, it is acceptable to perform subset testing, accompanied by an equivalency argument describing the evaluator’s sampling methodology.

=== Cryptographic Support (FCS)

==== FCS_COP.1/AEAD Cryptographic Operation – Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data

===== TSS
[arabic, start=318]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes the construction of any IVs, nonces, and tags in conformance with the relevant specifications.

. If a CCM mode algorithm is selected, then the evaluator shall examine the TOE summary specification to confirm that it describes how the nonce is generated and that the same nonce is never reused to encrypt different plaintext pairs under the same key.

. If a GCM mode algorithm is selected, then the evaluator shall examine the TOE summary specification to confirm that it describes how the IV is generated and that the same IV is never reused to encrypt different plaintext pairs under the same key.

*Encryption Algorithm Functional Tests*
[arabic, start=331]
. The evaluator shall generate 15 test cases using random data for each combination of the above parameters as follows:
* Each claimed key size,
* Each supported tag size,
* Four supported non-zero payload sizes, such that two are multiples of 128 bits and two are not multiples of 128 bits,
* Four supported non-zero associated data sizes, such that two are multiples of 128 bits and two are not multiples of 128 bits, and
* An associated data size of zero, if supported.

. Note that the IV size is always 96 bits.

. The evaluator shall compare the output from each test case against results generated by a known- good implementation with the same input parameters.

*Decryption Algorithm Functional Tests*

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.11*
[arabic, start=420]

[arabic, start=421]
. The evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the potential strengths (in terms of the number of bits in the symmetric key) of the algorithms that are allowed for the IKE and ESP exchanges. The TSS shall also describe the checks that are done when negotiating IKEv1 Phase 2 and/or IKEv2 CHILD_SA suites to ensure that the strength (in terms of the number of bits of key in the symmetric algorithm) of the negotiated algorithm is less than or equal to that of the IKE SA this is protecting the negotiation.

The description in the TSS shall also indicate how pre-shared key establishment is accomplished for TOEs that can generate a pre-shared key as well as TOEs that simply use a pre-shared key.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.14*
[arabic, start=424]
. The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE compares the peer’s presented identifier to the reference identifier. This description shall include which field(s) of the certificate are used as the presented identifier (DN, Common Name, or SAN). If the TOE simultaneously supports the same identifier type in the CN and SAN, the TSS shall describe how the TOE prioritizes the comparisons (e.g., the result of comparison if CN matches but SAN does not). If the location (e.g., CN or SAN) of non-DN identifier types must explicitly be configured as part of the reference identifier, the TSS shall state this. If the ST author assigned an additional identifier type, the TSS description shall also include a description of that type and the method by which that type is compared to the peer’s presented certificate, including what field(s) are compared and which fields take precedence in the comparison.

[arabic, start=425]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to verify it instructs the Administrator how to construct entries into the SPD that specify a rule for processing a packet. The description includes all three cases – a rule that ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and flow through the TOE without being encrypted. The evaluator shall determine that the description in the guidance documentation is consistent with the description in the TSS, and that the level of detail in the guidance documentation is sufficient to allow the administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion of how ordering of rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.

. The evaluator shall check the guidance documentation to ensure it provides instructions on how to configure the TOE to use the algorithms selected.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5*
[arabic, start=429]
. The evaluator shall check the guidance documentation to ensure it instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to use IKEv1 and/or IKEv2 (as selected), and how to configure the TOE to perform NAT traversal (if selected).
. If the IKEv1 Phase 1 mode requires configuration of the TOE prior to its operation, the evaluator shall check the guidance documentation to ensure that instructions for this configuration are contained within that guidance.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.6*
[arabic, start=431]
. The evaluator shall ensure that the guidance documentation describes the configuration of all selected algorithms in the requirement.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.7*
[arabic, start=432]
. The evaluator shall verify that the values for SA lifetimes can be configured and that the instructions for doing so are located in the guidance documentation. If time-based limits are supported, configuring the limit may lead to a rekey no later than the specified limit. For some implementations, it may be necessary, though, to configure the TOE with a lower time value to ensure a rekey is performed before the maximum SA lifetime of 24 hours is exceeded (e.g., configure a time value of 23h 45min to ensure the actual rekey is performed no later than 24h). The evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation allows the Administrator to configure the Phase 1 SA value of 24 hours or provides sufficient instruction about the time value to configure to ensure the rekey is performed no later than the maximum SA lifetime of 24 hours. It is not permitted to configure a value of 24 hours if that leads to an actual rekey after more than 24hours. Currently there are no values mandated for the number of bytes, the evaluator just ensures that this can be configured if selected in the requirement.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.8*
[arabic, start=433]
. The evaluator shall verify that the values for SA lifetimes can be configured and that the instructions for doing so are located in the guidance documentation. If time-based limits are supported, configuring the limit may lead to a rekey no later than the specified limit. For some implementations, it may be necessary, though, to configure the TOE with a lower time value to ensure a rekey is performed before the maximum SA lifetime of 8 hours is exceeded (e.g., configure a time value of 7h 45min to ensure the actual rekey is performed no later than 8h). The evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation allows the Administrator to configure the Phase 2 SA value of 8 hours or provides sufficient instruction about the time value to configure to ensure the rekey is performed no later than the maximum SA lifetime of 8 hours. It is not permitted to configure a value of 8 hours if that leads to an actual rekey after more than 8 hours. Currently there are no values mandated for the number of bytes, the evaluator just ensures that this can be configured if selected in the requirement.

. The evaluator shall ensure the guidance documentation describes how to set up the TOE to use certificates with RSA and/or ECDSA signatures and public keys.
. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation describes how pre-shared keys are to be generated and established. The description in the guidance documentation shall also indicate how pre-shared key establishment is accomplished for TOEs that can generate a pre-shared key as well as TOEs that simply use a pre-shared key.
. The evaluator shall ensure that the guidance documentation describes how to configure the TOE to connect to a trusted CA and ensure a valid certificate for that CA is loaded into the TOE and marked “trusted”.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.14*
[arabic, start=440]
. The evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance describes all supported identifiers, explicitly states whether the TOE supports the SAN extension or not and includes detailed instructions on how to configure the reference identifier(s) used to check the identity of peer(s). If the identifier scheme implemented by the TOE does not guarantee unique identifiers, the evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance provides a set of warnings and/or CA policy recommendations that would result in secure TOE use.

===== Tests

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.1*
[arabic, start=441]
. The evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the TOE to perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall configure the SPD such that there is a rule for dropping a packet, encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The selectors used in the construction of the rule shall be different such that the evaluator can generate a packet and send packets to the gateway with the appropriate fields (fields that are used by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports) in the packet header. The evaluator shall perform both positive and negative test cases for each type of rule (e.g., a packet that matches the rule and another that does not match the rule). The evaluator shall observe via the audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected behaviour: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed to flow without modification, encrypted by the IPsec implementation.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall devise several tests that cover a variety of scenarios for packet processing. As with Test 1, the evaluator shall ensure both positive and negative test cases are constructed. These scenarios must exercise the range of possibilities for SPD entries and processing modes as outlined in the TSS and guidance documentation. Potential areas to cover include rules with overlapping ranges and conflicting entries, inbound and outbound packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that belong to established SAs. The evaluator shall verify, via the audit trail and packet captures, for each scenario that the expected behaviour is exhibited, and is consistent with both the TSS and the guidance documentation.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.2*
[arabic, start=442]
. The assurance activity for this element is performed in conjunction with the activities for FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.1.
. The evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the TOE to perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall configure the SPD such that there is a rule for dropping a packet, encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The evaluator may use the SPD that was created for verification of FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.1. The evaluator shall construct a network packet that matches the rule to allow the packet to flow in plaintext and send that packet. The evaluator shall observe that the network packet is passed to the proper destination interface with no modification. The evaluator shall then modify a field in the packet header; such that it no longer matches the evaluator-created entries (there may be a “TOE created” final entry that discards packets that do not match any previous entries). The evaluator shall send the packet and observe that the packet was dropped.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.3*
[arabic, start=444]
. The evaluator shall perform the following test(s) based on the selections chosen:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: If tunnel mode is selected, the evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the TOE to operate in tunnel mode and also configures a VPN peer to operate in tunnel mode. The evaluator shall configure the TOE and the VPN peer to use any of the allowable cryptographic algorithms, authentication methods, etc. to ensure an allowable SA can be negotiated. The evaluator shall then initiate a connection from the TOE to connect to the VPN peer. The evaluator shall observe (for example, in the audit trail and the captured packets) that a successful connection was established using the tunnel mode.
.. Test 2: If transport mode is selected, the evaluator shall use the guidance documentation to configure the TOE to operate in transport mode and also configures a VPN peer to operate in transport mode. The evaluator shall configure the TOE and the VPN peer to use any of the allowed cryptographic algorithms, authentication methods, etc. to ensure an allowable SA can be negotiated. The evaluator shall then initiate a connection from the TOE to connect to the VPN peer. The evaluator shall observe (for example, in the audit trail and the captured packets) that a successful connection was established using the transport mode.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.4*
[arabic, start=445]

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5*
[arabic, start=446]
. Tests are performed in conjunction with the other IPsec evaluation activities.
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: If IKEv1 is selected, the evaluator shall configure the TOE as indicated in the guidance documentation and attempt to establish a connection using an IKEv1 Phase 1 connection in aggressive mode. This attempt should fail. The evaluator shall then show that main mode exchanges are supported.
.. Test 2: If NAT traversal is selected within the IKEv2 selection, the evaluator shall configure the TOE so that it will perform NAT traversal processing as described in the TSS and RFC 7296, Section 2.23. The evaluator shall initiate an IPsec connection and determine that the NAT is successfully traversed.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.6*
[arabic, start=447]
. The evaluator shall configure the TOE to use the ciphersuite under test to encrypt the IKEv1 and/or IKEv2 payload and establish a connection with a peer device, which is configured to only accept the payload encrypted using the indicated ciphersuite. The evaluator shall confirm the algorithm was that used in the negotiation.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.7*
[arabic, start=448]
. When testing this functionality, the evaluator shall ensure that both sides are configured appropriately. From the RFC “A difference between IKEv1 and IKEv2 is that in IKEv1 SA lifetimes were negotiated. In IKEv2, each end of the SA is responsible for enforcing its own lifetime policy on the SA and rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter lifetime will end up always being the one to request the rekeying. If the two ends have the same lifetime policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”
. Each of the following tests shall be performed for each version of IKE selected in the FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5 protocol selection:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: If ‘number of bytes’ is selected as the SA lifetime measure, the evaluator shall configure a maximum lifetime in terms of the number of bytes allowed following the guidance documentation. The evaluator shall configure a test peer with a byte lifetime that exceeds the lifetime of the TOE. The evaluator shall establish a SA between the TOE and the test peer, and determine that once the allowed number of bytes through this SA is exceeded, a new SA is negotiated. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE initiates a Phase 1 negotiation.
.. Test 2: If ‘length of time’ is selected as the SA lifetime measure, the evaluator shall configure a maximum lifetime no later than 24 hours for the Phase 1 SA following the guidance documentation. The evaluator shall configure a test peer with a Phase 1 SA lifetime that exceeds the Phase 1 SA lifetime on the TOE. The evaluator shall establish a SA between the TOE and the test peer, maintain the Phase 1 SA for 24 hours, and determine that a new Phase 1 SA is negotiated on or before 24 hours has elapsed. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE initiates a Phase 1 negotiation.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.8*
[arabic, start=450]
. When testing this functionality, the evaluator shall ensure that both sides are configured appropriately. From the RFC “A difference between IKEv1 and IKEv2 is that in IKEv1 SA lifetimes were negotiated. In IKEv2, each end of the SA is responsible for enforcing its own lifetime policy on the SA and rekeying the SA when necessary.

If the two ends have the same lifetime policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”
. Each of the following tests shall be performed for each version of IKE selected in the FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5 protocol selection:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: If ‘number of bytes’ is selected as the SA lifetime measure, the evaluator shall configure a maximum lifetime in terms of the number of bytes allowed following the guidance documentation. The evaluator shall configure a test peer with a byte lifetime that exceeds the lifetime of the TOE. The evaluator shall establish a SA between the TOE and the test peer, and determine that once the allowed number of bytes through this SA is exceeded, a new SA is negotiated. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE initiates a Phase 2 negotiation.
.. Test 2: If ‘length of time’ is selected as the SA lifetime measure, the evaluator shall configure a maximum lifetime no later than 8 hours for the Phase 2 SA following the guidance documentation. The evaluator shall configure a test peer with a Phase 2 SA lifetime that exceeds the Phase 2 SA lifetime on the TOE. The evaluator shall establish a SA between the TOE and the test peer, maintain the Phase 1 SA for 8 hours, and determine that once a new Phase 2 SA is negotiated when or before 8 hours has lapsed. The evaluator shall verify that the TOE initiates a Phase 2 negotiation.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.9*
[arabic, start=452]
. None.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.10*
[arabic, start=453]
. The following tests shall be performed.
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: If IKEv1 is supported, Configure the TOE to use IKEv1:
* Test 1.a: If “according to the security strength associated with the negotiated Diffie-
Hellman group” has been selected, for each supported authentication methods and DH groups, demonstrate the TOE uses phase 1 and phase 2 nonces meeting the strength requirement defined in NIST SP 800-57 for the appropriate DH group.
* Test 1.b: If “at least 128-bits in size and at least half the output size of the negotiated
pseudorandom function (PRF) hash” has been selected, for each supported authentication method and PRF hash, demonstrate the TOE uses phase 1 and phase 2 nonces suitable for the selected PRF.
.. Test 2: If IKEv2 is supported, configure the TOE to use IKEv2:

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.11*
[arabic, start=454]
. For each supported DH group, the evaluator shall test to ensure that all supported IKE protocols can be successfully completed using that particular DH group.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.12*
[arabic, start=455]
. The evaluator shall follow the guidance to configure the TOE to perform the following tests.
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: This test shall be performed for each version of IKE supported. The evaluator shall successfully negotiate an IPsec connection using each of the supported algorithms and hash functions identified in the requirements.
.. Test 2: This test shall be performed for each version of IKE supported. The evaluator shall attempt to establish a SA for ESP that selects an encryption algorithm with more strength than that being used for the IKE SA (i.e., symmetric algorithm with a key size larger than that being used for the IKE SA). Such attempts should fail.
.. Test 3: This test shall be performed for each version of IKE supported. The evaluator shall attempt to establish an IKE SA using an algorithm that is not one of the supported algorithms and hash functions identified in the requirements. Such an attempt should fail.
.. Test 4: This test shall be performed for each version of IKE supported. The evaluator shall attempt to establish a SA for ESP (assumes the proper parameters were used to establish the IKE SA) that selects an encryption algorithm that is not identified in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.4. Such an attempt should fail.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.13*
[arabic, start=456]
. For efficiency sake, the testing is combined with the testing for FIA_X509_EXT.1 and FIA_X509_EXT.2 from the Functional Package for X.509 (for IPsec connections), and FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.1.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.14*
[arabic, start=457]
. In the context of the tests below, a valid certificate is a certificate that passes FIA_X509_EXT.1 (from the Functional Package for X.509) validation checks but does not necessarily contain an authorised subject.
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1 [conditional]: For each CN/identifier type combination selected, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the field in the peer’s presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds. If the TOE prioritizes CN checking over SAN (through explicit configuration of the field when specifying the reference identifier or prioritization rules), the evaluator shall also configure the SAN so it contains an incorrect identifier of the correct type (e.g., the reference identifier on the TOE is example.com, the CN=example.com, and the SAN:FQDN=otherdomain.com) and verify that IKE authentication succeeds.
.. Test 2 [conditional]: For each SAN/identifier type combination selected, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the field in the peer’s presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds. If the TOE prioritizes SAN checking over CN (through explicit specification of the field when specifying the reference identifier or prioritization rules), the evaluator shall also configure the CN so it contains an incorrect identifier formatted to be the same type (e.g., the reference identifier on the TOE is DNS-ID; identify certificate has an identifier in SAN with correct DNS-ID, CN with incorrect DNS-ID (and not a different type of identifier)) and verify that IKE authentication succeeds.
.. Test 3 [conditional]: For each CN/identifier type combination selected, the evaluator shall:
[lowerroman]
... Create a valid certificate with the CN so it contains the valid identifier followed by ‘\0’. If the TOE prioritizes CN checking over SAN (through explicit specification of the field when specifying the reference identifier or prioritization rules) for the same identifier type, the evaluator shall configure the SAN so it matches the reference identifier.
... Configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the CN without the ‘\0’ and verify that IKE authentication fails.
[loweralpha, start=4]
.. Test 4 [conditional]: For each SAN/identifier type combination selected, the evaluator shall:
[lowerroman]
... Create a valid certificate with an incorrect identifier in the SAN. The evaluator shall configure a string representation of the correct identifier in the DN. If the TOE prioritizes CN checking over SAN (through explicit specification of the field when specifying the reference identifier or prioritization rules) for the same identifier type, the addition/modification shall be to any non-CN field of the DN. Otherwise, the addition/modification shall be to the CN.
... Configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the correct identifier (expected in the SAN) and verify that IKE authentication fails.
[loweralpha, start=5]
.. Test 5 [conditional]: If the TOE supports DN identifier types, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the subject DN in the peer’s presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds.
.. Test 6 [conditional]: If the TOE supports DN identifier types, to demonstrate a bit-wise comparison of the DN, the evaluator shall create the following valid certificates and verify that the IKE authentication fails when each certificate is presented to the TOE:
[lowerroman]
... Duplicate the CN field, so the otherwise authorised DN contains two identical CNs.
... Append ‘\0’ to a non-CN field of an otherwise authorised DN.

==== FCS_NTP_EXT.1 NTP Protocol

===== TSS

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.1*
[arabic, start=459]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it identifies the version of NTP supported, how it is implemented and what approach the TOE uses to ensure the timestamp it receives from an NTP timeserver (or NTP peer) is from an authenticated source and the integrity of the time has been maintained.
+
. The TOE must support at least one of the methods or may use multiple methods, as specified in the SFR element 1.2. The evaluator shall ensure that each method selected in the ST is described in the TSS, including the version of NTP supported in element 1.1, the message digest algorithms used to verify the authenticity of the timestamp and/or the protocols used to ensure integrity of the timestamp.

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.2, FCS_NTP_EXT.1.3, and FCS_NTP_EXT.1.4*
[arabic, start=461]
. None.

===== Guidance Documentation

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.1*
[arabic, start=462]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure it provides the Security Administrator instructions as how to configure the version of NTP supported, how to configure multiple NTP servers for the TOE’s time source and how to configure the TOE to use the method(s) that are selected in the ST.

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.2*
[arabic, start=463]
. For each of the secondary selections made in the ST, the evaluator shall examine the guidance document to ensure it instructs the Security Administrator how to configure the TOE to use the algorithms that support the authenticity of the timestamp and/or how to configure the TOE to use the protocols that ensure the integrity of the timestamp.
+
_Assurance Activity Note:_
+
Each primary selection in the SFR contains selections that specify a cryptographic algorithm or cryptographic protocol. For each of these secondary selections made in the ST, the evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure that the documentation instructs the Security Administrator how to configure the TOE to use the chosen option(s).

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.3*
[arabic, start=464]
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure it provides the Security Administrator instructions as how to configure the TOE to not accept broadcast and multicast NTP packets that would result in the timestamp being updated.

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.4*
[arabic, start=465]
. None.

===== Tests

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.1*
[arabic, start=466]
. The version of NTP selected in element 1.1 and specified in the ST shall be verified by observing establishment of a connection to an external NTP server known to be using the specified version(s) of NTP. This may be combined with tests of other aspects of FCS_NTP_EXT.1 as described below.

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.2*
[arabic, start=467]
. The cryptographic algorithms selected in element 1.2 and specified in the ST will have been specified in an FCS_COP SFR and tested in the accompanying Evaluation Activity for that SFR. Likewise, the cryptographic protocol selected in in element 1.2 and specified in the ST will have been specified in an FCS SFR and tested in the accompanying Evaluation Activity for that SFR.
+
[conditional] If the message digest algorithm is claimed in element 1.2, the evaluator shall configure the TOE and NTP server so the TOE can synchronize time using a claimed message digest algorithm. The evaluator shall modify the response(s) from the NTP server so the response(s) contains a MAC that was generated by a different message digest algorithm and confirm the TOE does not synchronize to this time source. Other than the invalid MAC, the NTP response(s) must be valid (e.g., key ID, key value used, timestamps).
+
Note: Since the algorithm is not identified in the server response, this tests an incorrect algorithm and an invalid MAC.
+
The evaluator shall use a packet sniffer to capture the network traffic between the TOE and the NTP server. The evaluator shall use the captured network traffic, to verify the NTP version, to observe time change of the TOE and uses the TOE’s audit log to determine that the TOE accepted the NTP server’s timestamp update.
+
The captured traffic is also used to verify that the appropriate message digest algorithm was used to authenticate the time source and/or the appropriate protocol was used to ensure integrity of the timestamp that was transmitted in the NTP packets.

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.3*
[arabic, start=468]
. The evaluator shall configure NTP server(s) to support periodic time updates to broadcast and multicast addresses. The evaluator shall confirm the TOE is configured to not accept broadcast and multicast NTP packets that would result in the timestamp being updated. The evaluator shall check that the time stamp is not updated after receipt of the broadcast and multicast packets.

*FCS_NTP_EXT.1.4*
[arabic, start=469]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall confirm the TOE supports configuration of at least three (3) NTP time sources. The evaluator shall configure at least three NTP servers to support periodic time updates to the TOE. The evaluator shall confirm the TOE is configured to accept NTP packets that would result in the timestamp being updated from each of the NTP servers. The evaluator shall check that the time stamp is updated after receipt of the NTP packets. The purpose of this test to verify that the TOE can be configured to synchronize with multiple NTP servers. It is up to the evaluator to determine that the multi- source update of the time information is appropriate and consistent with the behaviour prescribed by the RFC 1305 for NTPv3 and RFC 5905 for NTPv4.
.. Test 2: (The intent of this test is to ensure that the TOE would only accept NTP updates from configured NTP Servers.) The evaluator shall confirm that the TOE would not synchronize to other, not explicitly configured time sources by sending an otherwise valid but unsolicited NTP Server response indicating different time from the TOE’s current system time. This rogue time source needs to be configured in a way (e.g., degrade or disable valid and configured NTP servers) that could plausibly result in unsolicited updates becoming a preferred time source if they are not discarded by the TOE. The TOE is not mandated to respond in a detectable way or audit the occurrence of such unsolicited updates. It is up to the evaluator to craft and transmit unsolicited updates in a way that would be consistent with the behaviour of a correctly-functioning NTP server.

==== FIA_AFL.1 Authentication Failure Management

===== TSS
[arabic, start=470]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it contains a description, for each supported method for remote administrative actions, of how successive unsuccessful authentication attempts are detected and tracked. The TSS shall also describe the method by which the remote administrator is prevented from successfully logging on to the TOE, and the actions necessary to restore this ability.
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm that the TOE ensures that authentication failures by remote administrators cannot lead to a situation where no administrator access is available, either permanently or temporarily (e.g., by providing local logon which is not subject to blocking).

. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to ensure that instructions for configuring the number of successive unsuccessful authentication attempts and time period (if implemented) are provided, and that the process of allowing the remote administrator to once again successfully log on is described for each “action” specified (if that option is chosen). If different actions or mechanisms are implemented depending on the secure protocol employed (e.g., TLS vs. SSH), all must be described.
. The evaluator shall examine the guidance documentation to confirm that it describes, and identifies the importance of, any actions that are required in order to ensure that administrator access will always be maintained, even if remote administration is made permanently or temporarily unavailable due to blocking of accounts as a result of FIA_AFL.1.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=474]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests for each method by which remote administrators access the TOE (e.g., any passwords entered as part of establishing the connection protocol or the remote administrator application):
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall use the operational guidance to configure the number of successive unsuccessful authentication attempts allowed by the TOE (and, if the time period selection in FIA_AFL.1.2 is included in the ST, then the evaluator shall also use the operational guidance to configure the time period after which access is re-enabled). The evaluator shall test that once the authentication attempts limit is reached, authentication attempts with valid credentials are no longer successful.
.. Test 2: After reaching the limit for unsuccessful authentication attempts as in Test 1 above, the evaluator shall proceed as follows.
+
If the administrator action selection in FIA_AFL.1.2 is included in the ST, then the evaluator shall confirm by testing that following the operational guidance and performing each action specified in the ST to re-enable the remote administrator’s access results in successful access (when using valid credentials for that administrator).
+
If the time period selection in FIA_AFL.1.2 is included in the ST, then the evaluator shall wait for just less than the time period configured in Test 1 and show that an authorisation attempt using valid credentials does not result in successful access.

[arabic, start=480]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests.
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall compose passwords that meet the requirements in some way. For each password, the evaluator shall verify that the TOE supports the password. While the evaluator is not required (nor is it feasible) to test all possible compositions of passwords, the evaluator shall ensure that all characters, and a minimum length listed in the requirement are supported and justify the subset of those characters chosen for testing.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall compose passwords that do not meet the requirements in some way. For each password, the evaluator shall verify that the TOE does not support the password. While the evaluator is not required (nor is it feasible) to test all possible compositions of passwords, the evaluator shall ensure that the TOE enforces the allowed characters and the minimum length listed in the requirement and justify the subset of those characters chosen for testing.

==== FIA_PSK_EXT.1 Pre-Shared Key Composition

===== TSS

[arabic, start=481]

==== FPT_APW_EXT.1 Protection of Administrator Passwords

===== TSS
[arabic, start=484]

. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how the TOE reacts if X.509v3 certificates are used for trusted updates and the Security Administrator attempts to perform the trusted update using an expired certificate.
. The TSS shall describe the point at which revocation checking is performed and describe whether the Security Administrator can manually provide revocation information. It is expected that revocation checking is performed when a certificate is used when performing trusted updates. It is not sufficient to verify the status of a X.509v3 certificate only when it is loaded onto the device.

===== Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=490]
. The evaluator shall verify that the guidance documentation describes how the TOE reacts if X.509v3 certificates are used for trusted updates and the administrator attempts to perform the trusted update using an expired certificate. The evaluator shall verify any Security Administrator actions related to revocation checking, both accepting or rejecting certificates and manually providing revocation information. The description shall correspond to the description in the TSS.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=491]
. The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
[loweralpha, start=1]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall verify that the update mechanism includes a certificate validation according to FIA_X509_EXT.1 (in the Functional Package for X.509) and a check for the Code Signing purpose in the extendedKeyUsage.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall digitally sign the update with an invalid certificate and verify that update installation fails. The evaluator shall digitally sign the application with a certificate that does not have the Code Signing purpose and verify that application installation fails. The evaluator shall repeat the test using a valid certificate and a certificate that contains the Code Signing purpose and verify that the application installation succeeds. The evaluator shall use a previously valid but expired certificate and verifies that the TOE reacts as described in the TSS and the guidance documentation. Testing for this element is performed in conjunction with the assurance activities for FPT_TUD_EXT.1.
.. Test 3: The evaluator shall demonstrate that checking the validity of a certificate is performed at the time a certificate is used when performing trusted updates. It is not sufficient to verify the status of a X.509v3 certificate only when it is loaded onto the device.

.. Test 1: The evaluator shall try to enable and disable at least one of the services as defined in the Application Notes for FAU_GEN.1.1 (whichever is supported by the TOE) without prior authentication as Security Administrator (either by authenticating as a user with no administrator privileges, if possible, or without prior authentication at all). The attempt to enable/disable this service/these services should fail.
+
When there is an implementation where no other users other than the Security Administrator can be defined, the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt to enable/disable this service/these services can be executed without user authentication. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall try to enable and disable at least one of the services as defined in the Application Notes for FAU_GEN.1.1 (whichever is supported by the TOE) with prior authentication as Security Administrator.

=
When there is an implementation where no other users than the Security Administrator can be defined,  the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt to enable/disable automatic checking for updates can be executed without user authentication. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.
.. Test 2: The evaluator shall try to enable and disable automatic checking for updates or automatic updates (whichever is supported by the TOE) with prior authentication as Security Administrator. The attempt to enable/disable automatic checking for updates should be successful.

===== Tests
[arabic, start=517]
. The evaluator shall perform the following test:
[loweralpha]
.. Test 1: The evaluator shall follow the guidance documentation to configure several different values for the inactivity time period referenced in the component. For each period configured, the evaluator shall establish a local interactive session with the TOE. The evaluator shall then verify that the session is either locked or terminated after the configured time period. If locking was selected from the component, the evaluator shall then verify that re-authentication is needed when trying to unlock the session.

== Evaluation Activities for SARs

[arabic, start=518]
. The sections below specify EAs for the SARs included in the related cPPs (see Section 1.1). The EAs in Section 2 (Evaluation Activities for SFRs), Section 3 (Evaluation Activities for Optional Requirements), and Section 4 (Evaluation Activities for Selection-Based Requirements) are an interpretation of the more general CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology area of the TOE.
. In this section, each SAR that is contained in the cPP is listed, and the EAs that are not associated with an SFR are captured here, or a reference is made to the CEM, and the evaluator is expected to perform the CEM work units.

=== ASE: Security Target Evaluation

==== General Evaluation Activities for TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS.1) for All TOEs

[arabic, start=520]
. When evaluating a Security Target, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM. In addition, the evaluator shall ensure the content of the TSS in the ST satisfies the EAs specified in Section 2 (Evaluation Activities for SFRs).

==== Additional Evaluation Activities for TOE Summary Specification (ASE_TSS.1) for Distributed TOEs

[arabic, start=521]
. For distributed TOEs, only the SFRs classified as ‘all’ have to be fulfilled by all TOE parts. The SFRs classified as ‘One’ or ‘Feature Dependent’ only have to be fulfilled by either one or some TOE parts, respectively. To make sure that the distributed TOE as a whole fulfills all the SFRs the following actions for ASE_TSS.1 have to be performed as part of ASE_TSS.1.1E.

[cols="15%,50%",options="header",width=90%]
|===
|*ASE_TSS.1 element* |*Evaluator Action*
|ASE_TSS.1.1C
|The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it is clear which TOE components contribute to each SFR or how the components combine to meet each SFR.

The evaluator shall verify the sufficiency to fulfil the related SFRs. This includes checking that the TOE as a whole fully covers all SFRs and that all functionality that is required to be audited is in fact audited regardless of the component that carries it out.
|===
[arabic, start=522]
. Note that additional Evaluation Activities for the TSS in the case of a distributed TOE are defined in Appendix B.4.

=== ADV: Development

==== Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)
[arabic, start=523]
. The EAs for this assurance component focus on understanding the interfaces (e.g., application programming interfaces, command line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, network interfaces) described in the AGD documentation, and possibly identified in the TSS in response to the SFRs. Specific evaluator actions to be performed against this documentation are identified (where relevant) for each SFR in Section 2, and in EAs for AGD, ATE and AVA SARs in other parts of Section 5.
. The EAs presented in this section address the CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-1, ADV_FSP.1-2, ADV_FSP.1-3, and ADV_FSP.1-5.
. The EAs are reworded for clarity and interpret the CEM work units such that they will result in more objective and repeatable actions by the evaluator. The EAs in this SD are intended to ensure the evaluators are consistently performing equivalent actions.
. The documents to be examined for this assurance component in an evaluation are therefore the Security Target, AGD documentation, and any required supplementary information required by the cPP: no additional “functional specification” documentation is necessary to satisfy the EAs. The interfaces that need to be evaluated are also identified by reference to the EAs listed for each SFR and are expected to be identified in the context of the Security Target, AGD documentation, and any required supplementary information defined in the cPP rather than as a separate list specifically for the purposes of CC evaluation. The direct identification of documentation requirements and their assessment as part of the EAs for each SFR also means that the tracing required in ADV_FSP.1-4, ADV_FSP.1-6 and ADV_FSP.1-7 is treated as implicit and no separate mapping information is required for this element.

[cols=",",options="header",]

|*CEM ADV_FSP.1 Work Units* |*Evaluation Activities*
|ADV_FSP.1-1 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the functional specification to determine that it states the purpose of each SFR-supporting and SFR-enforcing TSFI.

|ADV_FSP.1-4 The evaluator *_shall examine_* the rationale provided by the developer for the implicit categorisation of interfaces as SFR-non-interfering to determine that it is accurate.
|Work unit ADV_FSP.1-4 from the [CEM] states: “In the case where the developer has provided adequate documentation to perform the analysis called for by the rest of the work units for this component without explicitly identifying SFR-enforcing and SFR-supporting interfaces, this work unit should be considered satisfied.”

Since the rest of the ADV_FSP.1 work units will have been satisfied upon completion of the EAs, it follows that this work unit is satisfied as well.
|ADV_FSP.1-5 The evaluator *_shall check_* that the tracing links the SFRs to the corresponding TSFIs. |5.2.1.3 Evaluation Activity: The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation and confirm that all security-relevant interfaces are described.

[[sd-table-1-adv-fsp-mapping]]_Table 1: Mapping of ADV_FSP.1 CEM Work Units to Evaluation Activities_

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=527]
. _The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to ensure it describes the purpose and method of use for each TSFI that is identified as being security relevant._
. In this context, TSFI are deemed security relevant if they are used by the administrator to configure the TOE, or to perform other administrative functions (e.g., audit review or performing updates). Explicitly labelling TSFI as security relevant or non-security relevant is not necessary. A TSFI is implicitly security relevant if it is used to satisfy an evaluation activity, or if it is identified in the ST or guidance documentation as adhering to the security policies (as presented in the SFRs). The intent is that these interfaces will be adequately tested and having an understanding of how these interfaces are used in the TOE is necessary to ensure proper test coverage is applied. According to the description above 'security relevant' corresponds to the combination of 'SFR-enforcing' and 'SFR-supporting' as defined in CC Part 3, page 36 last paragraph.
. The set of TSFI that are provided as evaluation evidence are contained in the Security Target and the guidance documentation.

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=530]
. _The evaluator shall check the interface documentation to ensure it identifies and describes the parameters for each TSFI that is identified as being security relevant._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=531]
. _The evaluator shall examine the interface documentation to develop a mapping of the interfaces to SFRs._
. The evaluator shall use the provided documentation to identify and examine a representative set of interfaces to perform the EAs presented in Section 2, including the EAs associated with testing of the interfaces.
. It should be noted that there may be some SFRs that do not have a TSFI that is explicitly “mapped” to invoke the desired functionality. For example, generating a random bit string or destroying a cryptographic key that is no longer needed are capabilities that may be specified in SFRs, but are not invoked by an interface.
. The required EAs define the design and interface information required to meet ADV_FSP.1. If the evaluator is unable to perform an EA, then the evaluator shall conclude that an adequate functional specification has not been provided.

=== AGD: Guidance Documents
[arabic, start=535]
. It is not necessary for a TOE to provide separate documentation to meet the individual requirements of AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE. Although the EAs in this section are described under the traditionally separate AGD families, the mapping between the documentation provided by the developer and AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE requirements may be many-to-many, as long as all requirements are met in documentation that is delivered to Security Administrators and users (as appropriate) as part of the TOE.
. Note that additional EAs for the guidance documentation in the case of a distributed TOE are defined in Appendix B.4.

==== Operational User Guidance (AGD_OPE.1)
[arabic, start=537]
. The evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with the AGD_OPE.1 SAR. Specific requirements and EAs on the guidance documentation are identified (where relevant) in the individual EAs for each SFR. For the related evaluation activities, the evaluation evidence documents Security Target, AGD documentation (user guidance) and functional specification documentation (if provided) shall be used as input documents. Each input document is subject to ALC_CMS.1-2 requirements.
. In addition, the evaluator performs the EAs specified below.

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=539]
. _The evaluator shall verify the Operational guidance documentation is distributed to Security Administrators and users (as appropriate) as part of the TOE, so that there is a reasonable guarantee that Security Administrators and users are aware of the existence and role of the documentation in establishing and maintaining the evaluated configuration._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=540]
. _The evaluator shall verify that the Operational guidance is provided for every Operational Environment that the product supports as claimed in the Security Target and shall adequately address all platforms claimed for the TOE in the Security Target._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=541]
. _The evaluator shall verify that the Operational guidance contains instructions for configuring any cryptographic implementation associated with the evaluated configuration of the TOE. It shall provide a warning to the administrator that use of other cryptographic implementations was not evaluated nor tested during the CC evaluation of the TOE._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=542]
. _The evaluator shall verify the Operational guidance makes it clear to an administrator which security functionality and interfaces have been assessed and tested by the EAs._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=543]
. In addition, the evaluator shall verify that the following requirements are also met.
[loweralpha]
.. The guidance documentation shall contain instructions for configuring any cryptographic implementation associated with the evaluated configuration of the TOE. It shall provide a warning to the administrator that use of other cryptographic implementations was not evaluated nor tested during the CC evaluation of the TOE.
.. The evaluator shall verify that this process includes instructions for obtaining the update itself. This should include instructions for making the update accessible to the TOE (e.g., placement in a specific directory).
[loweralpha, start=3]
.. The TOE will likely contain security functionality that does not fall in the scope of evaluation under this cPP. The guidance documentation shall make it clear to an administrator which security functionality is covered by the EAs.

==== Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)
[arabic, start=544]
. The evaluator will perform the CEM work units associated with the AGD_PRE.1 SAR. Specific requirements and EAs on the preparative documentation are identified (and where relevant are captured in the Guidance Documentation portions of the EAs) in the individual EAs for each SFR.
. Preparative procedures are distributed to Security Administrators and users (as appropriate) as part of the TOE, so that there is a reasonable guarantee that Security Administrators and users are aware of the existence and role of the documentation in establishing and maintaining the evaluated configuration.
. In addition, the evaluator performs the EAs specified below.

===== Evaluation Activity:
[arabic, start=547]
. _The evaluator shall examine the Preparative procedures to ensure they include a description of how the Security Administrator verifies that the operational environment can fulfil its role to support the security functionality (including the requirements of the Security Objectives for the Operational Environment specified in the Security Target)._
. The documentation should be in an informal style and should be written with sufficient detail and explanation that it can be understood and used by the target audience (which will typically include IT staff who have general IT experience but not necessarily experience with the TOE product itself).

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=549]
. _The evaluator shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they are provided for every Operational Environment that the product supports as claimed in the Security Target and shall adequately address all platforms claimed for the TOE in the Security Target._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=550]
. _The evaluator shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they include instructions to successfully install the TSF in each Operational Environment._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=551]
. _The evaluator shall examine the preparative procedures to ensure they include instructions on how to manage the TSF as a product and as a component of the larger Operational Environment in a manner that allows to preserve integrity of the TSF._

. _The intent of this requirement is to ensure there exists adequate preparative procedures (guidance in most cases) to put the TSF in a secure state (i.e., evaluated configuration). AGD_PRE.1 lists general requirements, the specific assurance activities implementing it are performed as part of FMT_SMF.1, FMT_MTD.1 and FMT_MOF.1 series of SFRs._

===== Evaluation Activity
[arabic, start=553]
. In addition, the evaluator shall verify that the following requirements are also met.
. The preparative procedures must:
[loweralpha]
.. include instructions to provide a protected administrative capability; and
.. identify TOE passwords that have default values associated with them and mandate that they shall be changed.

=== ALC: Life-cycle Support

==== Labelling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)
[arabic, start=555]
. When evaluating that the TOE has been provided and is labelled with a unique reference, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== TOE CM Coverage (ALC_CMS.1)
[arabic, start=556]
. When evaluating the developer’s coverage of the TOE in their CM system, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== Basic Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR.1) (optional)
[arabic, start=557]
. When evaluating the developer’s procedures regarding basic flaw remediation, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== Flaw Reporting Procedures (ALC_FLR.2) (optional)
[arabic, start=558]
. When evaluating the developer’s flaw reporting procedures, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

==== Systematic Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR.3) (optional)
[arabic, start=559]
. When evaluating the developer’s procedures regarding systematic flaw remediation, the evaluator performs the work units as presented in the CEM.

=== ATE: Tests

==== Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)
[arabic, start=560]
. The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in the SFRs are being met. Additionally, testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the TSS, as well as the dependencies on the Operational guidance documentation is accurate.
. The evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with the ATE_IND.1 SAR. Specific testing requirements and EAs are captured for each SFR in Sections 2, 3 and 4.
. The evaluator shall consult Appendix B when determining the appropriate strategy for testing multiple variations or models of the TOE that may be under evaluation.
. Note that additional Evaluation Activities relating to evaluator testing in the case of a distributed TOE are defined in Appendix B.4.

=== AVA: Vulnerability Assessment

==== Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)
[arabic, start=564]
. While vulnerability analysis is inherently a subjective activity, a minimum level of analysis can be defined and some measure of objectivity and repeatability (or at least comparability) can be imposed on the vulnerability analysis process. In order to achieve such objectivity and repeatability it is important that the evaluator shall follow a set of well-defined activities and documents their findings so others can follow their arguments and come to the same conclusions as the evaluator. While this does not guarantee that different evaluation facilities will identify exactly the same type of vulnerabilities or come to exactly the same conclusions, the approach defines the minimum level of analysis and the scope of that analysis and provides Certification Bodies a measure of assurance that the minimum level of analysis is being performed by the evaluation facilities.
. In order to meet these goals some refinement of the AVA_VAN.1 CEM work units is needed. The following table indicates, for each work unit in AVA_VAN.1, whether the CEM work unit is to be performed as written, or if it has been clarified by an Evaluation Activity. If clarification has been provided, a reference to this clarification is provided in the table.

[cols=",",options="header",]

[[sd-table-2-ava-van-mapping]]_Table 2: Mapping of AVA_VAN.1 CEM Work Units to Evaluation Activities_

[arabic, start=566]
. Because of the level of detail required for the evaluation activities, the bulk of the instructions are contained in Appendix A, while an “outline” of the assurance activity is provided below.

===== Evaluation Activity (Documentation):
[arabic, start=567]
. In addition to the activities specified by the CEM in accordance with Table 2, the evaluator shall perform the following activities.
. _The evaluator shall examine the documentation outlined below provided by the developer to confirm that it contains all required information. This documentation is in addition to the documentation already required to be supplied in response to the EAs listed previously._
. The developer shall provide documentation identifying the list of software and hardware componentsfootnote:[In this sub-section the term “components” refers to parts that make up the TOE. It is therefore distinguished from the term “distributed TOE components”, which refers to the parts of a TOE that are present in one physical part of a distributed TOE. Each distributed TOE component will therefore generally include a number of the hardware and software components that are referred to in this sub-section: for example, each distributed TOE component will generally include hardware components such as processors and software components such as an operating system and libraries.] that compose the TOE. Hardware components should identify compute-capable hardware components, at a minimum that must include the processor, and where applicable, discrete crypto ASICs, TPMs, etc. used by the TOE. Software components include applications, the operating system and other major components that are independently identifiable and reusable (outside of the TOE), for example a web server, protocol or cryptographic implementations, (independently identifiable and reusable components are not limited to the list provided in the example). This additional documentation is merely a list of the name and version number of the components and will be used by the evaluators in formulating vulnerability hypotheses during their analysis.
. If the TOE is a distributed TOE then the developer shall provide:
[loweralpha]
.. documentation describing the allocation of requirements between distributed TOE components as in [NDcPP, 3.4]
.. a mapping of the auditable events recorded by each distributed TOE component as in [NDcPP, Table 2]
.. additional information in the Preparative Procedures as identified in the refinement of AGD_PRE.1 in additional information in the Preparative Procedures as identified in 3.4.1.2.

===== Evaluation Activity:
[arabic, start=571]
. The evaluator shall formulate hypotheses in accordance with process defined in Appendix A. The evaluator shall document the flaw hypotheses generated for the TOE in the report in accordance with the guidelines in Appendix A.3. The evaluator shall perform vulnerability analysis in accordance with Appendix A.2. The results of the analysis shall be documented in the report according to Appendix A.3.

== Required Supplementary Information
[arabic, start=572]
. This Supporting Document refers in various places to the possibility that ‘required supplementary information’ may need to be supplied as part of the deliverables for an evaluation. This term is intended to describe information that is not necessarily included in the Security Target or operational guidance, and that may not necessarily be public. Examples of such information could be entropy analysis, or description of a cryptographic key management architecture used in (or in support of) the TOE. The requirement for any such supplementary information will be identified in the relevant cPP.
. The cPPs associated with this SD require an entropy analysis as described in [NDcPP, Appendix D].

== Vulnerability Analysis
[arabic, start=569]

=== Sources of Vulnerability Information
[arabic, start=574]
. CEM Work Unit AVA_VAN.1-3 has been supplemented in this Supporting Document to provide a better-defined set of flaws to investigate and procedures to follow based on this particular technology. Terminology used is based on the flaw hypotheses methodology, where the evaluation team hypothesizes flaws and then either proves or disproves those flaws (a flaw is equivalent to a “potential vulnerability” as used in the CEM). Flaws are categorized into four “types” depending on how they are formulated:
[arabic]
.. A list of flaw hypotheses applicable to the technology described by the cPP (in this case, a network device) derived from public sources as documented in Appendix A.1.1 – this fixed set has been agreed by the iTC. Additionally, this will be supplemented with entries for a set of public sources (as indicated below) that are directly applicable to the TOE or its identified components (as defined by the process in Appendix A.1.1 below); this is to ensure that the evaluators include in their assessment applicable entries that have been discovered since the cPP was published;
.. A list of flaw hypotheses listed in this document that are derived from lessons learned specific to that technology and other iTC input (that might be derived from other open sources and vulnerability databases, for example) as documented in Appendix A.1.2;
.. A list of flaw hypotheses derived from information available to the evaluators; this includes the baseline evidence provided by the developer described in this Supporting Document (documentation associated with EAs, documentation described in Section 5.6.1.2, documentation described in Section 6), as well as other information (public and/or based on evaluator experience) as documented in Appendix A.1.3; and
.. A list of flaw hypotheses that are generated through the use of TC-defined tools (e.g., nmap, fuzz testers) and their application as specified in Appendix A.1.4.

==== Type 1 Hypotheses – Public-Vulnerability-Based
[arabic, start=575]
. The list of public sources of vulnerability information selected by the iTC is given in Appendix A.4.
. The evaluators shall perform a search on the sources listed in Appendix A.4 to determine a list of potential flaw hypotheses that are specific to the TOE and its components as specified by the additional documentation mentioned above. Any duplicates – either in a specific entry, or in the flaw hypothesis that is generated from an entry from the same or a different source – can be noted and removed from consideration by the evaluation team.
. According to Section 5.6.1.1, the developer shall provide documentation identifying the list of software and hardware components that compose the TOE. The evaluator shall independently verify this list for completeness by comparing it to the security functionality defined in the TSS of the ST and ensuring that all expected components are accounted for.
Hardware components should identify at a minimum the processors used by the TOE. Software components that are in the scope of this requirement include libraries, frameworks, operating system and other major components that are independently identifiable and reusable (i.e., can be present in other products) components. The evaluator shall use the components list and determine that the TOE and its components are free of unmitigated vulnerabilities. It is expected that all remotely exploitable vulnerabilities present in the network device shall be considered as part of vulnerability assessment ("network device" is used to refer to the entire device and is not limited to the claimed security functionality).
The search criteria to be used when searching the sources shall include:
* The list of software and hardware components that compose the TOE
* The TOE name (including model information as appropriate)
+
As the search terms can contain proprietary information and there is a possibility that this information could be used by attackers to identify potential attack surfaces, there is no expectation that search terms containing proprietary information are published in any public-facing document.

[arabic, start=578]
. As part of type 1 flaw hypothesis generation for the specific components of the TOE, the evaluator shall also search the component manufacturer’s websites to determine if flaw hypotheses can be generated on this basis (for instance, if security patches have been released for the version of the component being evaluated, the subject of those patches may form the basis for a flaw hypothesis).

==== Type 2 Hypotheses – iTC-Sourced
[arabic, start=579]
. Appendix A.5 contains the list of flaw hypothesis generated by the iTC for this technology that must be considered by the evaluation team as flaw hypotheses in performing the vulnerability assessment.
. If the evaluators discover a Type 3 or Type 4 flaw that they believe should be considered as a Type 2 flaw in future versions of this cPP, they should work with their CB to determine the appropriate means of submitting the flaw for consideration by the iTC.

==== Type 3 Hypotheses – Evaluation-Team-Generated
[arabic, start=581]
. Type 3 flaws are formulated by the evaluator based on information presented by the product (through on-line help, product documentation and user guides, etc.) and product behaviour during the (functional) testing activities. The evaluator is also free to formulate flaws that are based on material that is not part of the baseline evidence (e.g., information gleaned from an Internet mailing list, or reading interface documentation on interfaces not included in the set provided by the developer), although such activities have the potential to vary significantly based upon the product and evaluation facility performing the analysis.
. If the evaluators discover a Type 3 flaw that they believe should be considered as a Type 2 flaw in future versions of this cPP, they should work with their CB to determine the appropriate means of submitting the flaw for consideration by the iTC.

==== Type 4 Hypotheses – Tool-Generated
[arabic, start=583]
. The evaluator is recommended but not mandated to perform Fuzz Testing to generate Type 4 flaw hypotheses. Fuzz testing is a method where a set of randomly generated inputs is used to induce an observable fault. If this approach is selected, the evaluator shall e.g., identify a protocol implementing one or more SFR-enforcing TSFI(s) and conduct fuzz testing by varying selected fields in that protocol. For example, if the TOE’s remote administrative interface is secured with TLS, Fuzz Testing of the SSL record header or the TLS handshake message would be appropriate. Any results that are unexpected (e.g., core dumps, inappropriate errors, or unplanned reboots) should be investigated and resolved. If Fuzz Testing is performed, the evaluator shall focus on security-relevant parts of the TOE that have not been subjected to Fuzz Testing multiple times (like publicly available libraries), but instead focus on custom parts of the TOE (if such information is available to the evaluator).

. Additionally, the evaluator shall utilize an automated port scanning tool as part of the vulnerability assessment process. It is up to the evaluator to select the applicable tools, however there is an expectation that any utilized tool is actively maintained.

. The iTC has not identified a specific tool to be used in accomplishing the above flaw hypothesis generation activity, so any tool used by the evaluation team is acceptable. The evaluation team shall record in the test report the name, version, parameters, and results of all test tools used for this activity.
. If the evaluators discover a Type 4 flaw that they believe should be considered as a Type 2 flaw in future versions of this cPP, they should work with their CB to determine the appropriate means of submitting the flaw for consideration by the iTC.

=== Process for Evaluator Vulnerability Analysis
[arabic, start=587]
. As flaw hypotheses are generated from the activities described above, the evaluation team will disposition them; that is, attempt to prove, disprove, or determine the non-applicability of the hypotheses. This process is as follows:
* The evaluator shall refine each flaw hypothesis for the TOE and attempt to disprove it using the information provided by the developer or through penetration testing.
* During this process, the evaluator is free to interact with the developer to determine if the flaw exists, including requests to the developer for additional evidence (e.g., detailed design information, consultation with engineering staff).
* In case of a confirmed flaw, the CB should be informed.
* Should the developer object to the information being requested as being not compatible with the overall level of the evaluation activity/cPP and cannot provide evidence otherwise that the flaw is disproved, the evaluator shall prepare an appropriate set of materials as follows:
[arabic, start=588]
.. The source documents used in formulating the hypothesis, and why it represents a potential compromise against a specific TOE function;
.. An argument why the flaw hypothesis could not be proven or disproved by the evidence provided so far;
.. The type of information required to investigate the flaw hypothesis further.
* The CB will then either approve or disapprove the request for additional information. If approved, the developer provides the requested evidence to disprove the flaw hypothesis (or, of course, acknowledge the flaw).
* For each hypothesis, the evaluator shall note whether the flaw hypothesis has been successfully disproved, successfully proven to have identified a flaw, or requires further investigation. It is important to have the results documented as outlined in Appendix A.3 below.
* If the evaluator finds a flaw, the evaluator shall report these flaws to the developer. All reported flaws must be addressed as follows:
.. If the developer confirms that the flaw exists and that it is exploitable at Basic Attack Potential, then a change is made by the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation report.
.. If the developer, the evaluator, and the CB agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential and does not require resolution for any other reason, then no change is made, and the flaw is noted as a residual vulnerability in the CB-internal report (ETR).
.. If the developer and evaluator agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential, but it is deemed critical to fix because of technology-specific or cPP-specific aspects such as typical use cases or operational environments, then a change is made by the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation report.
.. Disagreements between evaluator and developer regarding questions of the existence of a flaw, its attack potential, or whether it should be deemed critical to fix are resolved by the CB.
. Any testing performed by the evaluator shall be documented in the test report as outlined in Appendix A.3 below.
. As indicated in Appendix A.3, the public statement with respect to vulnerability analysis that is performed on TOEs conformant to the cPP is constrained to coverage of flaws associated with Types 1 and 2 (defined in Appendix A.1) flaw hypotheses only. The fact that the iTC generates these candidate hypotheses indicates these must be addressed.

=== Reporting
[arabic, start=590]
. The evaluators shall produce two reports on the testing effort; one that is public-facing (that is, included in the non-proprietary evaluation report, which is a subset of the Evaluation Technical Report (ETR)) and the complete ETR that is delivered to the overseeing CB.
. The public-facing report contains:
* The flaw identifiers returned when the procedures for searching public sources were followed according to instructions in the Supporting Document per Appendix A.1.1;
* A statement that the evaluators have examined the Type 1 flaw hypotheses specified in this Supporting Document in Appendix A.1.1 (i.e., the flaws listed in the previous bullet) and the Type 2 flaw hypotheses specified in this Supporting Document by the iTC in Appendix A.1.2;
. A statement that the evaluation team developed Types 3 and 4 flaw hypotheses in accordance with Sections A.1.3, A.1.4, and A.2, and that no residual vulnerabilities exist that are exploitable by attackers with Basic Attack Potential as defined by the CB in accordance with the guidance in the CEM. It should be noted that this is just a statement about the “fact of” Types 3 and 4 flaw hypotheses being developed, and that no specifics about the number of flaws, the flaws themselves, or the analysis pertaining to those flaws will be included in the public-facing report.
. No other information is provided in the public-facing report.
. The internal CB report contains, in addition to the information in the public-facing report:
* A list of all of the flaw hypotheses generated (see AVA_VAN.1-4);
* The evaluator penetration testing effort, outlining the testing approach, configuration, depth and results (see AVA_VAN.1-9);
* All documentation used to generate the flaw hypotheses (in identifying the documentation used in coming up with the flaw hypotheses, the evaluation team must characterize the documentation so that a reader can determine whether it is strictly required by this Supporting Document, and the nature of the documentation (design information, developer engineering notebooks, etc.));
* The evaluator shall report all exploitable vulnerabilities and residual vulnerabilities, detailing for each:
** Its source (e.g., CEM activity being undertaken when it was conceived, known to the evaluator, read in a publication);
** The SFR(s) not met;
** A description;
** Whether it is exploitable in its operational environment or not (i.e., exploitable or residual).
** The amount of time, level of expertise, level of knowledge of the TOE, level of opportunity and the equipment required to perform the identified vulnerabilities (see AVA_VAN.1-11);
* How each flaw hypothesis was resolved (this includes whether the original flaw hypothesis was confirmed or disproved, and any analysis relating to whether a residual vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with Basic Attack Potential) (see AVA_VAN1-10); and
* In the case that actual testing was performed in the investigation (either as part of flaw hypothesis generation using tools specified by the iTC in Appendix A.1.4, or in proving/disproving a particular flaw) the steps followed in setting up the TOE (and any required test equipment); executing the test; post-test procedures; and the actual results (to a level of detail that allow repetition of the test, including the following:
** Identification of the potential vulnerability the TOE was/is being tested for;
** Instructions to connect and setup all required test equipment as required to conduct the penetration test;
** Instructions to establish all penetration test prerequisite initial conditions;
** Instructions to stimulate the TSF;
** Instructions for observing the behaviour of the TSF;
** Descriptions of all expected results and the necessary analysis to be performed on the observed behaviour for comparison against expected results;
** Instructions to conclude the test and establish the necessary post-test state for the TOE. (see AVA_VAN.1-6, AVA_VAN.1-8).

[appendix]
== Network Device Equivalency Considerations
=== Introduction
[arabic, start=604]
. This appendix provides a foundation for evaluators to determine whether a developer’s request for equivalency of products for different models wishing to claim conformance to the NDcPP is allowed.
. For the purpose of evaluation, equivalency can be broken into two categories:
* *Variations in models*: Separate TOE models/variations may include differences that could necessitate separate testing across each model. If there are no variations in any of the categories listed below, the models may be considered equivalent.
* *Variations in TOE dependencies on the environment (e.g., OS/platform the product is tested on)*: The method a TOE provides functionality (or the functionality itself) may vary depending upon the environment on which it is installed. If there is no difference in the TOE-provided functionality or in the manner in which the TOE provides the functionality, the models may be considered equivalent.

. Determination of equivalency between models can result in different testing outcomes:
* If a set of multiple different TOE instances are determined to be equivalent, testing may be performed on a single variation of the TOE. However, if the TOE variations have security-relevant functional differences, each of the TOE models that exhibits either functional or structural differences must be separately tested. Generally speaking, only the difference between each variation of TOE must be separately tested. Other equivalent functionality may be tested on a representative model and not across multiple platforms.
* If it is determined that a TOE operates the same regardless of the environment, testing may be performed on a single instance for all equivalent configurations. However, if the TOE is determined to provide environment-specific functionality, testing must take place in each environment for which a difference in functionality exists. Similar to the above scenario, only the functionality affected by environment differences must be retested.
. If a developer disagrees with the evaluator’s assessment of equivalency, the CB will arbitrate between the two parties as to whether equivalency exists.

=== Evaluator Guidance for Determining Equivalence

====  Strategy
[arabic, start=608]
. When performing the equivalency analysis, the evaluator shall consider each factor independently. A factor may be any number of things at various levels of abstraction, ranging from the processor a device uses, to the underlying operating system and hardware platform a software application relies upon. Examples may be the various chip sets employed by the product, the type of network interface (different device drivers), storage media (solid state drive, spinning disk, EEPROM). It is important to consider how the difference in these factors may influence the TOE’s ability to enforce the SFRs. Each analysis of an individual factor will result in one of two outcomes,
* For the particular factor, all variations of the TOE on all supported platforms are equivalent. In this case, testing may be performed on a single model in a single test environment and cover all supported models and environments.
* For the particular factor, a subset of the product has been identified to require separate testing to ensure that it operates identically to all other equivalent TOE. The analysis would identify the specific combinations of models/testing environments that needed to be tested.

. Complete CC testing of the product would encompass the totality of each individual analysis performed for each of the identified factors.

====  Guidance for Network Devices

[arabic, start=610]
. The following table provides a description of how an evaluator shall consider each of the factors that affect equivalency between TOE model variations and across operating environments. Additionally, the table also identifies scenarios that will result in additional separate testing across models.

[cols="20%,15%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|*Factor* |*Same/Not Same* |*Evaluator Guidance*
|*Platform/Hardware Dependencies* |Independent |If there are no identified platform/hardware dependencies, the evaluator shall consider testing on multiple hardware platforms to be equivalent.
| |Dependencies |If there are specified differences between platforms/hardware, the evaluator must identify if the differences affect the cPP-specified security functionality or if they apply to non-cPP-specified functionality. If functionality specified in the cPP is dependent upon platform/hardware provided services, the product must be tested on each of the different platforms to be considered validated on that particular hardware combination. In these cases, the evaluator has the option of only re-testing the functionality dependent upon the platform/hardware provided functionality. If the differences only affect non-cPP-specified functionality, the variations may still be considered equivalent. For each difference the evaluator must provide an explanation of why the difference does or does not affect cPP-specified functionality.
|*Differences in TOE Software Binaries* |Identical |If the model binaries are identical, the model variations shall be considered equivalent.
| |Different |If there are differences between model software binaries, a determination must be made if the differences affect cPP-specified security functionality. If cPP-specified functionality is affected, the models are not considered equivalent and must be tested separately. The evaluator has the option of only retesting the functionality that was affected by the software differences. If the differences only affect non-PP specified functionality, the models may still be considered equivalent. For each difference the evaluator must provide an explanation of why the difference does or does not affect cPP specified functionality.
|*Differences in Libraries Used to Provide TOE Functionality* |Same |If there are no differences between the libraries used in various TOE models, the model variations shall be considered equivalent.
| |Different |If the separate libraries are used between model variations, a determination of whether the functionality provided by the library affects cPP-specified functionality must be made. If cPP-specified functionality is affected, the models are not considered equivalent and must be tested separately. The evaluator has the option of only retesting the functionality that was affected by the differences in the included libraries. If the different libraries only affect non-PP specified functionality, the models may still be considered equivalent. For each different library, the evaluator must provide an explanation of why the different libraries do or do not affect cPP specified functionality.
|*TOE Management Interface Differences* |Consistent |If there are no differences in the management interfaces between various TOE models, the model variations shall be considered equivalent.
| |Differences |If the product provides separate interfaces based on the model variation, a determination must be made of whether cPP-specified functionality can be configured by the different interfaces. If the interface differences affect cPP-specified functionality, the variations are not considered equivalent and must be separately tested. The evaluator has the option of only retesting the functionality that can be configured by the different interfaces (and the configuration of said functionality). If the different management interfaces only affect non-PP specified functionality, the models may still be considered equivalent. For each management interface difference, the evaluator must provide an explanation of why the different management interfaces do or do not affect cPP specified functionality.
|*TOE Functional Differences* |Identical |If the functionality provided by different TOE model variation is identical, the models variations shall be considered equivalent.
| |Different |If the functionality provided by different TOE model variations differ, a determination must be made if the functional differences affect cPP-specified functionality. If cPP-specific functionality differs between models, the models are not considered equivalent and must be tested separately. In these cases, the evaluator has the option of only retesting the functionality that differs model-to-model. If the functional differences only affect non-cPP specified functionality, the model variations may still be considered equivalent. For each difference the evaluator must provide an explanation of why the difference does or does not affect cPP specified functionality.

[[sd-table-3-equivalency-analysis]]_Table 3: Evaluation Equivalency Analysis_

=== Test Presentation/Truth in Advertising
[arabic, start=611]
. In addition to determining what to test, the evaluation results (and resulting Certification Report) must identify the actual TOE and environment combinations that have been tested. The analysis used to determine the testing subset may be considered proprietary and will only optionally be publicly included.

=== Evaluating Additional Components for a Distributed TOE
[arabic, start=612]
. In the case of a distributed TOE, the Security Target will identify an evaluated configuration that consists of a number of separate TOE components chosen by the ST author, which collectively satisfy the requirements of the cPP. This evaluated configuration need not be the minimum set of components that could _possibly_ meet the cPP (e.g., if the TOE is intended for large enterprise deployments then the evaluated configuration might include some redundancy in components in order to support expected connectivity and loads), but because this is the main configuration referred to in the ST and the evaluation, it is treated in this section as the minimum configuration of interest and is referred to here as the ‘minimum configuration’ as well as the ‘evaluated configuration’.
. In addition to the minimum configuration, the ST may also identify (at the author’s discretion, and subject to verification as described in this section) which TOE components can have instances added to an operational configuration without affecting the validity of the CC certification. The TOE description in the ST may include constraints on how such components are added, including required and/or prohibited configurations of the components.
. Extra instances of a TOE component must have the same hardware and software as the original component included in the evaluated configuration.
. It is noted that undesirable configurations may be possible in the operational deployment of a TOE – such as allowing a TOE component to be managed from separate and potentially conflicting administration domains. However, the definition of ‘undesirable’ and of the risks involved in such cases will be specific to each operational environment and is therefore not treated as part of the evaluation. Correct and appropriate configuration of this sort remains a matter for expert network planning and design in the operational environment.

==== Evaluator Actions for Assessing the ST

=====  TSS
[arabic, start=616]
. The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm it identifies any extra/additional instances of specific TOE components allowed in the ST and what effects will occur when extra instances of distributed TOE components are added. The information in the TSS shall allow the evaluator to understand how a system with one specific TOE component behaves in comparison to a system with multiple instances of that same TOE component.  The TSS also shall describe how the additional TOE component instances maintain the SFRs to determine it is consistent with the role the singular TOE component plays in the evaluated configuration, and that the additional TOE components cannot be used in a way that the security functionality would be corrupted or bypassed. In general, any additional TOE component must not have a negative impact on other already-present components that are already part of the TOE.

==== Evaluator Actions for Assessing the Guidance Documentation

=====  Guidance Documentation
[arabic, start=617]
. The evaluator shall examine the description of the extra instances of TOE components in the guidance documentation to confirm that they are consistent with those identified as allowed in the ST. This includes confirmation that the result of applying the guidance documentation to configure the extra components will leave the TOE in a state such that the claims for SFR support in each component are as described in the ST and therefore that all SFRs continue to be met when the extra components are present.
. The evaluator shall examine the secure communications described for the extra components to confirm that they are the same as described for the components in the minimum configuration (additional connections between allowed extra components and the components in the minimum configuration are allowed of course).

==== Evaluator Actions for Testing the TOE

=====  Tests
[arabic, start=619]
. The evaluator shall test the TOE in the minimum configuration as defined in the ST (and the guidance documentation).
. If the description of the use of extra components in the ST and guidance documentation identifies any difference in the SFRs allocated to a component, or the scope of the SFRs involved (e.g., if different selections apply to different instances of the component) then the evaluator shall test these additional SFR cases that were not included in the minimum configuration.
. In addition, the evaluator shall test the following aspects for each extra component that is identified as allowed in the distributed TOE:
* Communications: the evaluator shall follow the guidance documentation to confirm, by testing, that any additional connections introduced with the extra component(s) and not present in the minimum configuration are consistent with the requirements stated in the ST (e.g., with regard to protocols and ciphersuites used). An example of such an additional connection would be if a single instance of the component is present in the minimum configuration and adding a duplicate component then introduces an extra communication between the two instances. Another example might be if the use of the additional components necessitated the use of a connection to an external authentication server instead of using locally stored credentials.
* Audit: the evaluator shall confirm that the audit records from different instances of a component can be distinguished so that it is clear which instance generated the record.
